<strong>A perspective from HECAP+</strong><br />
</p>
<p><span><strong>Sustainable HECAP+ Initiative</strong></span></p>
</div>
<p><br />
The climate crisis and the degradation of the world’s ecosystems require
humanity to take immediate action. The international scientific
community has a responsibility to limit the negative environmental
impacts of basic research. The <strong>HECAP+ communities</strong>
(<strong>High Energy Physics, Cosmology, Astroparticle Physics, and
Hadron and Nuclear Physics</strong>) make use of common and similar
experimental infrastructure, such as accelerators and observatories, and
rely similarly on the processing of big data. Our communities therefore
face similar challenges to improving the sustainability of our research.
This document aims to reflect on the environmental impacts of our work
practices and research infrastructure, to highlight best practice, to
make recommendations for positive changes, and to identify the
opportunities and challenges that such changes present for wider aspects
of social responsibility.<br />

<p><span><strong>Changes in version 2.0:</strong></span> Clarifications
have been added in relation to the authorship of this document on the
title page and in the Statement of Intent; the inset on personal
emissions and the figure reproduced in full from Ref. [10] have been
removed in favour of a text-based discussion of the elements of the
study [10] that give relevant context to research-related emissions; the
text beneath the right-hand chart of Figure 1.3 has been corrected to
indicate per-researcher rather than per-capita numbers, and
clarifications have been added to the caption to Figure 1.4 and the
accompanying text in relation to “per-researcher” emissions; corrections
and clarifications have been made in the Computing section in relation
to the High-Luminosity phase of the Large Hadron Collider; a correction
was made to the left-most bar of Figure 4.1; and the paragraphs on
low-carbon nuclear energy and the discussions on energy import and
export via HVDC cables in Section 3.1.2 and Case Study 3.3 of the Energy
section have been revised. Other minor typographical and grammatical
changes have been made.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="statement-of-intent">Statement of Intent</h1>
<p>This reflective document was developed by a small group of concerned
members of the HECAP+ communities (see ), beginning as a grassroots
initiative <span><em>Striving towards Environmental Sustainability in
High Energy Physics, Cosmology and Astroparticle
Physics</em></span>.</p>
<p>Its focus is not to stipulate the research that our communities
should undertake, nor to debate its intrinsic value. Rather, it is
intended to be a synthesis of current data, best practices, and research
in climate science and sustainability, as applied to our fields to the
best of our ability as physicists, and a reflection on the roles that
our communities can play in limiting negative environmental impacts due
to our research work and scientific culture.</p>
<p>The scope of the document is inspired by the holistic approach of
annual environmental reports of major institutes <span class="citation"
data-cites="Environment:2737239 FermilabEnvReport2019">[1], [2]</span>,
which include emissions directly related to research and collateral
emissions, such as from personal commutes and institutional catering.
Any imbalance in its content, in part, reflects imbalances in the
availability of reliable data and resources relating to the
environmental impact of aspects of our communities’ activities.
Redressing this imbalance will require input from across our
communities, in particular to identify the technical challenges of
limiting the environmental impacts of our current and future research
infrastructure.</p>
<p>While this document is primarily framed from the perspectives of high
energy physics, cosmology, astroparticle physics, and hadron and nuclear
physics (HECAP+), much of its discussion applies to basic research more
generally. Its broad scope is intended to provide a first step toward
greater coordination across the community in efforts to address
environmental sustainability, and it is hoped that it may serve as a
useful reference for our and other fields.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What should we do to limit the negative environmental impacts arising
from our scientific community?</p>
<p>Productive discussions on this crucial issue are often hindered by a
number of roadblocks. Climate change scepticism is fortunately not very
frequent in our community, but the same cannot be said, for instance, of
<em>climate change whataboutism</em> — “What about other communities who
produce way more greenhouse gas emissions than us? Why should we make
efforts, when others are not doing enough?”.</p>
<p>But even for those of us who recognize the importance of doing
something, a general lack of data and detailed information often
prevents us from aligning our actions with our ethical values — “Does my
Carbon footprint increase more by flying to conferences a couple of
times a year or by eating red meat a couple of times a week? By
computing or by commuting?”.</p>
<p>This timely and thought-provoking paper, arising from the grassroots
initiative <em>Striving towards Environmental Sustainability in High
Energy Physics, Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics</em>, provides a
much welcome reflection on how to remove these and other common
roadblocks towards sustainability, and how to put in place concrete
actions to limit our environmental impact.</p>
<p>The reader will find here a synthesis of current data, best
practices, and research in climate science and sustainability, and a set
of concrete recommendations that clearly show how we can empower
individuals and the broader community to take direct action and
responsibility for mitigating climate change.</p>
<p>I encourage every member of our community to reflect upon the
contents of this document and to actively engage in the ongoing dialogue
surrounding this crucial topic. I hope it will spark broader change and
promote a culture of sustainability in our community and beyond.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The conclusions from the IPCC are clear: global heating and climate
change are an existential threat to human civilization. All aspects of
society need to follow the recommended guidelines and eliminate
greenhouse gas emissions as quickly as possible. The research fields of
particle physics, cosmology and astroparticle physics have a role to
play in this great transition. Not only are the emissions associated
with those fields relatively large compared to other areas of daily
life, but as researchers and scientists we understand the science and we
can use our creativity and ingenuity in finding solutions. By placing
sustainability at the forefront of our scientific approaches, we will
provide guidance to other research fields and convey to society the
importance of this topic. It is our duty to act now such that future
generations can also enjoy the wonders of exploring the secrets of the
universe. We used to pride ourselves with being great innovators at the
cutting edge of technology. Let’s be ambitious again and help tackle all
of the challenges associated with a net zero economy. In the process we
will improve our health and make our research fields more diverse and
accessible to all regions of the Earth. As scientists ourselves we can
not ignore the science, there is a climate emergency and everyone needs
to play their part.</p>

<p>The climate crisis is one of the most pressing problems facing
humanity today: the long-term survival of our species, and countless
others, will be impacted critically by when and how we choose to address
it. This is not an issue we can ignore or put off; action needs to be
taken in the very near-term — the next few decades — if we are to avoid
a critical rise in mean global temperature that is predicted to result
in major changes to climate and weather patterns, the first signs of
which we are already experiencing. Of course tackling such a monumental
issue requires global collaboration and coordinated action by world
governments. But as individuals, as well as via our memberships of
teams, groups, institutes, laboratories and research organisations, each
of us can, and must, take our individual responsibility for helping to
ensure the vitality of our planetary environment and sustainability of
its resources.</p>
<p>For those of us working in the scientific fields represented, this
report provides a clarion call for action on sustainability. The report
both draws attention to the environmental impacts of pursuing our
scientific endeavours in a ‘business-as-usual’ fashion and, moreover,
highlights actions that we can take to reduce significantly these
impacts. In many cases these involve straightforward changes to
behaviour and practice that will yield benefits almost immediately. In
other cases more effort will be required and the benefits may be
realised later. The point is: we owe it to ourselves to take action, and
we can start now. This report is timely and it contains many
constructive recommendations; the findings are widely applicable within
the broader scientific community, and well beyond.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the context of the climate crisis, the scientific community is
part of the solution — through research, teaching and evidence-based
policy advice. However — and this aspect has traditionally been much
less in focus — the scientific community is also part of the problem,
through the emissions that it produces through its own operations. This
report illustrates starkly, how large that problem is: for some
researchers, emissions caused by their work are not just somewhat higher
than the current average global per-capita emissions or the per-capita
budget to 2050, they are roughly an order of magnitude higher (see
Fig. 1.4, p. 17). In the face of such data, inaction can cost the HECAP+
community i) the credibility and trust it enjoys both from policy-makers
and society at large, ii) the enthusiasm for HECAP+ topics that turns
young students (many of whom care passionately about solving the climate
crises) into next generation’s researchers and iii) even its research
freedom, because it is likely that societal pressure will increase as
the climate crisis progresses and policy makers will ultimately step in
to regulate carbon-intensive sectors much more strictly.</p>
<p>Yet, there is ground for hope. As the report illustrates, there are
already best practise examples that others in the HECAP+ community can
learn from. Beyond the existing examples, the report provides actionable
recommendations at three critical levels: the level of the individual,
the level of research groups and the level of institutions. These three
levels are necessary to achieve a change in culture towards a climate
sustainable research community. Such a change in culture will happen, if
individual behaviours and framework conditions (often set at the
institutional level) that determine norms and incentives, change. The
recommendations in this report provide first steps that the HECAP+
community can take to achieve this cultural change. Everyone in the
community should read about, reflect on and, wherever possible,
implement such steps.</p>

<p>All of us have roles to play in combating the climate crisis that is
bearing down upon us and the generations to come. Some of these roles
are individual, such as our personal lifestyle choices, whereas others
are collective, linked to our activities in society. As scientists
studying fundamental physical laws, astroparticle physics and cosmology,
our activities burden us with particular responsibilities. For example,
the scales of our research facilities imply that we consume orders of
magnitude more resources than is sustainable for the bulk of humanity,
so we must strive to research as efficiently as possible. This implies
minimising the wall-plug power and other resources consumed by our
accelerators, experiments and data analyses. Moreover, the international
nature of our research teams implies that we travel more than most, so
we should strive to travel as sustainably as possible, e.g., by train,
and as little as possible, e.g., by using teleconferencing tools such as
Zoom or Teams. On the other hand, our research can provide humanity with
valuable tools for living more sustainably. For example, the World-Wide
Web, which CERN placed in the public domain 30 years ago, has enabled
information to be shared and the planet’s business to be conducted more
efficiently and therefore sustainably. Moreover, instruments that we
develop can provide tools for monitoring and possibly mitigating the
effects of climate change. Finally, through our international contacts
we can both learn and disseminate best practice. Individually and
collectively we have unique responsibilities and opportunities to follow
the right paths: let us take them.</p>

<p>In the past century the ever increasing resource demands of humans
have a devastating impact on the climate of our planet. The resulting
heat waves, droughts, strong rain falls, violent storms, melting ice and
rising sea levels are posing an existential threat to many people
world-wide already today, and even more in the future. This situation
demands action from all of us individually, and as groups and
institutions, to do whatever we can to reduce (or ideally eliminate) the
emission of <span

generally to preserve the resources of the planet. This report
illustrates well that scientists working in the fields of high energy
physics, cosmology, astroparticle physics, hadron and nuclear physics
are using on average more resources than what will be acceptable, and
action is needed immediately. Many recommendations are proposed for
individuals, groups and/or institutions. Some are rather easy while
others are challenging and require core habits to change. Given the very
international nature of the research performed in these fields, there is
a large potential to propagate the actions to 100s of institutions in
countries of all continents and thereby increasing the impact further. I
very much hope this document will help us embark on the right path.</p>

<p>Many of us who study astrophysics and cosmology do so out of a sense
of awe and wonder at the universe. That same sense of wonder should
compel us to consider the impact of our work on our planet. We work in
areas that are driven by data, and the data on climate change shows
clearly how humans continue to impact the climate. This extensive report
presents a summary of the ways in which our work contributes to
increases in emissions of greenhouse gases, collectively through our
international projects and individually through personal choices. It is
a sobering look at our impact, and provides recommendations for how we
can effect change collectively within our research communities,
collaborations and institutions.</p>
<p>International collaboration drives progress in the large, complex
projects that we undertake to unravel the secrets of the cosmos. These
projects often involve significant infrastructure investment and require
a large computing budget. On the largest scale, the report challenges us
to examine how we can reduce the environmental impact of the projects as
a whole. This will require from us a renewed prioritisation of
energy-efficiency, and strategic thinking to balance our research needs
with these time-critical actions. At an individual level, it suggests
ways to reduce impact on the climate by considering how we can reduce
our international travel, while considering solutions that are inclusive
of all members in our collaborations, regardless of geographic location.
This will again require creativity — but I am confident that as
researchers who have been trained in solving difficult problems we can
rise to the challenge.</p>

<p>The challenges posed by the human-made climate crisis, the largest,
most rapidly developing and pervasive threat to the natural environment
and societies the world has yet experienced, are enormous. They are
created by ever-growing human consumption, bolstered by rising energy
production and its inefficient use and waste. This energy is
predominantly generated by the massive combustion of fossil fuels,
predictably leading to the greenhouse effect we are experiencing. While
fossil fuels are the dominant source of greenhouse gases, direct release
of these gases also contributes to global climate change. As scientists
we have the responsibility to transparently expose the extent to which
we contribute to the problem, as discussed in this document, and help
develop solutions. Among the biggest challenges for current experiments
is the emission of greenhouse gases by detectors developed and built
decades ago, in some cases using gases that were at that time thought to
be environmentally-friendly alternatives to even more harmful gases.
Energy efficiency throughout all our instruments, including
considerations of their embodied carbon, is another important challenge.
All these challenges require and receive our immediate attention. Future
high-energy colliders and experiments will need to be ’green’: they will
have to rely on decarbonated energy sources and employ detector
technologies that avoid the use of greenhouse gases. I am confident that
our field will meet these challenges and contribute to building a
sustainable future.</p>

rather, it threatens our own survival and the survival of the bio- and

no alternative planet which will provide for us, so we better not make
our current one uninhabitable. Climate research has been clear on the
effects of climate change, and slowly the rising sea levels, the
disappearance of glaciers, the frequency of hundred year floods, the
storms, droughts, and heat waves beat the message home: climate change
is happening, human action is the cause, and we better counter-act it
immediately. As fellow scientists from the areas of high energy physics,
cosmology, and astroparticle physics, we are trained to understand and

<p>Humanity’s impact upon the world’s climate and ecosystems is now as
unequivocal as it is extreme <span class="citation"
data-cites="IPCC2021reportSPM">[3]</span>. Averting this climate
catastrophe must be a critical concern for all global citizens at this
pivotal time in world history.</p>
<p><strong>High Energy Physics</strong>, <strong>Cosmology</strong>,
<strong>Astroparticle Physics</strong>, and <strong>Hadron and Nuclear
Physics</strong> (<strong><span data-acronym-label="hecap"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">hecap</span></strong>) research has
direct impacts on the environment. Our research infrastructure,
including accelerators, detectors, telescopes and computing resources,
requires enormous power generation and, in many cases, contributes
directly to greenhouse gas (<span data-acronym-label="ghg"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">ghg</span>) emissions. Our work
practices give rise to additional emissions, e.g., from procurement,
business travel and commuting, and our industry generates various forms
of waste that are harmful to the environment.</p>
<p>As scientists working in HECAP+ and related disciplines, our
responsibilities to limit and mitigate our impact on the world’s climate
and ecosystems are manifold. Our opportunities and training have given
us the science capital to appreciate the evidence that has been collated
over many years by climate and environmental science. We must use our
unique and privileged platform to impel positive changes in, as well as
educate and advocate on, environmental sustainability and the connected
issues of social justice. Moreover, as a community focused on basic
scientific research, we should be no less accountable for our impacts on
the world’s climate and ecosystems than any other industry, and we
should anticipate that our activities will come under increasing
scrutiny from the public, governments and funders. We have moral and
pragmatic obligations to act.</p>
<p>This document follows the holistic approach taken by several
HECAP+ institutions in their annual environmental reports (see,
e.g., Refs. <span class="citation"
data-cites="Environment:2737239 FermilabEnvReport2019">[1], [2]</span>)
in assessing the environmental impacts of HECAP+ research across six
areas: computing, energy, food, mobility, research infrastructure and
technology, and resources and waste, also within the larger context of
global emissions. Specific recommendations are made for each of these
areas, but the overarching message is simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span><strong>Assessing, reporting on, defining targets for, and
undertaking coordinated efforts to limit our negative impacts on the
world’s climate and ecosystems must become an integral part of how we
plan and undertake all aspects of our research.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requires urgent action at an individual level, at a group level
(including research groups, collaborations and organising committees),
and at an institutional level (including universities, research
institutes, funding agencies, and professional societies). Moreover, it
requires systematic positive changes in everything from our day-to-day
activities and the ways we interact as a global community through to the
design and running of the ‘big science’ infrastructure on which
HECAP+ research depends.</p>
<p>It should be emphasised that the reduction of GHG emissions or other
environmental impacts from any source identified in this report should
be considered a priority by the community, whatever the comparative
scale of these impacts. Carbon offsetting via legitimate providers (see
Ref. <span class="citation" data-cites="Uni22">[4]</span>) should be
seen as a last resort, used only once all other options for reducing the
<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span> equivalent (<span
data-acronym-label="co2e"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">co2e</span>) emissions have been
exhausted and to offset any residual CO<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>e output.</p>
<p>We urge all members of the HECAP+ and related communities to take
individual actions and push for group- and institution-level changes
that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establish community-wide formal and coordinated efforts to assess
and improve the environmental sustainability of basic research, which
calls for standardised reporting and data sharing.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the environmental cost of computational infrastructure
and algorithms in decision making and prioritise the development of
common and reusable software solutions across HECAP+.</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritise the use of sustainable and renewable energy to power
our workspaces and research infrastructure; increase their energy
efficiency and recovery, and energy storage capacity.</p></li>
<li><p>Move towards plant-based catering at conferences and in
cafeterias, immediately reducing the provision of carbon-intensive
foods, such as ruminant meats and dairy products.</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritise environmentally sustainable modes of transport for
commuting where possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritise responsible business travel that balances in-person
and online meetings, acknowledges the benefits of virtual and hybrid
meetings for inclusivity, and considers the disproportionate impact of
changes to travel culture on different groups, e.g., early career
researchers and those who are geographically isolated.</p></li>
<li><p>Mandate comprehensive life-cycle analysis for all proposed
research infrastructure projects that critically assesses the
environmental impact of all project stages, including design and
approval, construction, commissioning, operation, maintenance,
decommissioning, and removal.</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritise environmentally- and socially-sustainable sourcing of
raw materials for experiments and infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p>Propagate and expand the culture of “reduce, reuse, repair,
recycle”, including the implementation of life-cycle awareness and
end-of-life planning for hardware.</p></li>
<li><p>Educate and advocate on issues of environmental sustainability
and social justice, and engage more broadly with policy makers to push
for wider change, e.g., the improvement and decarbonization of local
transport infrastructure.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="outline">Outline</h1>
<p>The aims of this document are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To improve awareness of the impact that high energy physics,
cosmology and astroparticle physics, and hadron and nuclear physics
(<span data-acronym-label="hecap"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">hecap</span>) has on the
environment.</p></li>
<li><p>To provide suggestions and encourage immediate action on ways
that we, as a community, can play our part in limiting further
degradation of the world’s climate and ecosystems.</p></li>
<li><p>To provide impetus for ongoing and collective discussions of how
we can make positive changes to our community’s work practices, in terms
of environmental sustainability and for the issues of social justice
from which climate change and environmental degradation cannot be
disentangled.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The aims are not to stipulate the research that our communities
should undertake, nor to debate its intrinsic value.</p>
<p>The discussions are divided into seven sections. Sections 2 through 7
cover the topics of Computing, Energy, Food, Mobility, Research
Infrastructure and Technology, and Resources and Waste. Each of these

about the current status of the climate and the damaging impact that
humanity continues to have upon it <span class="citation"
data-cites="IPCC2021reportSPM">[3]</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere,
ocean and land. Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean,
cryosphere and biosphere have occurred. […] Human-induced climate change
is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region
across the globe. Evidence of observed changes in extremes such as
heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical cyclones, and, in
particular, their attribution to human influence, has strengthened since
[the Fifth Assessment Report in 2014]."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is also clear on the consequences of further inaction <span
class="citation" data-cites="IPCC2021reportSPM">[3]</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Global surface temperature will continue to increase until at least
mid-century under all emissions scenarios considered. Global warming of
1.5C and 2C will be exceeded during the 21<span
class="math inline">\(^\text{st}\)</span> century unless deep reductions
in <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> and other
greenhouse gas emissions occur in the coming decades. […] Many changes
in the climate system become larger in direct relation to increasing
global warming. They include increases in the frequency and intensity of
hot extremes, marine heatwaves, heavy precipitation, and, in some
regions, agricultural and ecological droughts; an increase in the
proportion of intense tropical cyclones; and reductions in Arctic sea
ice, snow cover and permafrost."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Net global <span data-acronym-label="co2e"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">co2e</span> emissions must be halved
before 2030 to fulfill the Paris Climate Agreement. Without this, we are
unlikely to meet the target of limiting global warming to 1.5C in order
to avoid fatal tipping points in the global biosphere (see Figure <a

consumers, role models, and professionals” <span class="citation"
data-cites="IPCC2022reportSPM">[8]</span>, and includes many
HECAP+ physicists (notwithstanding significant disparities in income
within our communities depending on location and career stage). A recent
meta-study from Lund University <span class="citation"
data-cites="Wynes_2017">[10]</span> concluded that the most impactful
individual climate actions include: living car free (country-averaged

avoiding one transatlantic flight (1.6 <span

<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{tCO}_2\mathrm{e}\)</span> reduction
per year). Note that the numbers quoted were based on “average

<p>These work-related emissions are due to choices we make, as
individuals, collaborations, or institutions. They could be a direct
consequence of HECAP+ research, such as the choice of detector design;
computing setup or software pipeline for simulation and analysis; or how
we collaborate or communicate the results of our work. Alternatively
they could be peripherally related to the science we do: e.g., how we
commute between our home and workplace, or the food we consume while at
work; or how our offices are powered, heated and ventilated.
Historically, many of these choices have been made prioritising cost or
convenience over environmental and social impact. However, the rapid and
systemic societal change needed to keep to our climate change goals
requires system-wide engagement at all levels of academia. We can impel
positive change throughout the academic research system by re-assessing
these choices and how central they are to our primary function as
scientists.</p>
<p>This process has already begun. Universities and other institutions
are including sustainability in buildings planning (see Best Practice <a
href="#BP:Nikhef" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="BP:Nikhef">[BP:Nikhef]</a>) and engaging with voluntary
assessments of the environmental sustainability of their research
facilities (see e.g., Refs. <span class="citation"
data-cites="Environment:2737239 Jahnke2020 Beisert2020 Nikhef FermilabEnvReport2019">[1],
[2], [19]–[21]</span>). Examples focussed on the environmental
sustainability of laboratories include France’s Labos1point5 (see Best
Practice <a href="#BP:l1p5" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="BP:l1p5">[BP:l1p5]</a>) and University College London’s

data-cites="LEAF_impact">[25]</span>. The LEAF initiative, which awards
three levels of certification to participating laboratories, is
structured around online tools that promote best practice, and aid
calculations of impact and reporting, as well as additional resources

data-cites="Nikhef">[21]</span>. The building is undergoing a major
renovation in 2021–2023, which will remove the need for gas for heating.
Instead, the heat from the nearby data centre will be used, in addition
to better thermal insulation of the building.</p>
<p>The Nikhef sustainability roadmap <span class="citation"
data-cites="Nikhef">[21]</span> covers all sources of direct and
indirect carbon emissions. For instance, by 2030, air travel should be
reduced by 50% and daily commuting should be climate neutral.
Intermediate targets for 2025 are also set and yearly emissions will be
monitored and reported.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.2" id="sec:other_initiatives"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Previous and Parallel
Initiatives</h2>
<p>This document is focused on environmental sustainability and
associated social justice issues of particular relevance to the
activities of HECAP+. It is important to acknowledge the attention that
these topics are rightly being given across our communities. This
includes, e.g., in conference plenary talks and in parallel tracks
devoted to sustainability, and equity, equality, diversity, inclusivity
and accessibility. This section provides a brief review of other
documents with similar and complementary focuses on environmental and
wider social responsibilities.</p>

id="allea-towards-climate-sustainability-of-the-academic-system-in-europe-and-beyond"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> ALLEA, Towards Climate
Sustainability of the Academic System in Europe and Beyond</h3>
<p>The All European Academies (ALLEA) Working Group on Climate
Sustainability in the Academic System published a report in May
2022 <span class="citation" data-cites="ALLEA">[26]</span>, the aim of
which is "to assess current practices and to critically examine current
and proposed measures." The document urges stakeholders — either
individual (researchers and students) or structural (universities,
funding bodies, conference organisers, ranking agencies, and policy
makers) — to know their roles and responsibilities toward a
climate-sustainable academic system. After summarizing available data on
GHG emissions from various stakeholders and reviewing the current
practices aimed at reducing those emissions, the report outlines
recommendations for individual and group stakeholders. Dimensions of
social justice and equity are among the principles underlying all
recommendations, as well as the opportunity for the academic system to
be a role model in the matter. While all group stakeholders are advised
to embed sustainability in their strategies, individual ones
differ: students and academic members are encouraged to hold university
management accountable, to demand divestment and to generate awareness.
The importance of the development of an evidence base is emphasised,
along with mix-and-match approaches to meeting formats. Finally,
stakeholders are pushed to allocate funding to the decarbonization of
the academic system.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.2.2"
id="snowmass-contribution-climate-impacts-of-particle-physics"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2.2</span> Snowmass Contribution,
Climate Impacts of Particle Physics</h3>
<p>The report "Climate impacts of particle physics" <span
class="citation" data-cites="Bloom:2022gux">[27]</span>, submitted to
the proceedings of the US Community Study on the Future of Particle
Physics (Snowmass 2021) focuses on facility construction, detector
gases, computing, and GHG emissions from particle physics laboratories.
The report highlights two key motivations for addressing the ecological
and climate impacts of particle physics: (i) that the particle physics
community has a moral obligation to do so and (ii) that its professional
activities will be under increasing scrutiny from a number of
stakeholders. The latter means that the community will be under
increasing pressure to justify its carbon emissions against its relative
size, compared to other industries, and its societal benefits.</p>
<p>As a concrete example, the report focuses on the Future Circular
Collider (FCC) — the proposed 100 TeV electron-positron (and later
hadron) collider. The authors estimate that the construction of the
roughly 100 km circumference tunnel alone would lead to <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span> emissions at the level of a
few hundred kilotons, several times more than other large US building
projects. This corresponds to "per physicist" emissions 80 times larger
than their estimated 1.1 <span data-acronym-label="tco2"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">tco2</span> per capita per year limit
needed to keep global warming to less that 1.5C. The authors emphasise
the significant impact of the GHGs used in particle physics detectors
and for cooling, which can have warming potential that exceeds that of
<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span> by as much as four
orders of magnitude (in the case of <span class="math inline">\({\rm
SF}_6\)</span>). The report then highlights a number of avenues for
reducing the GHG emissions due to the electricity consumption of
computing, which is pivotal to running and exploiting such facilities.
It also discusses the additional emissions due to collaborative research
activities, with a particular emphasis on taking careful steps to reduce
air travel that capitalise on potential benefits for social justice
while minimising unintended negative consequences for members of the
community.</p>
<p>The report’s recommendations stress the need for reporting on planned
emissions and energy usage for new facilities; standardised reporting of
emissions across the sector, and community-wide engagement to tackle the
negative climate impacts of particle physics research through dedicated
research time.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.2.3"
id="recommendations-by-the-yhep-association-in-germany"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2.3</span> Recommendations by the yHEP
association in Germany</h3>
<p>The young High Energy Physicists (yHEP) association in Germany
published the "yHEP recommendations on improvement of environmental
sustainability in science" <span class="citation"
data-cites="yHEP1">[28]</span> and its Addendum <span class="citation"
data-cites="yHEP2">[29]</span> in December 2020 and 2021, respectively.
The documents, which were the result of proposals from the yHEP
community, including HECAP, hadron and nuclear, and accelerator
physicists, contain ideas for improving the environmental sustainability
of basic research. They take a qualitative approach on a broad range of
topics, including, but not limited to, travel, conferences, computing
and infrastructure, resource management and financing, and green
energy.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.3" id="impelling-positive-change"><span
class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Impelling Positive Change</h2>
<p>The aim of this document is to provide as comprehensive a discussion
as practicable of the various impacts of HECAP+ research, from our
day-to-day activities through to the large infrastructure projects on
which our science depends. The discussions presented here have much in
common with those of the documents described in Section <a
href="#sec:other_initiatives" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:other_initiatives">1.2</a>. This document is,
however, intended to have broad scope and, through case studies and best
practice, to illustrate potential actions that can be implemented at
individual, group and institutional levels to limit the impacts of
HECAP+ research on the world’s climate and ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, if the HECAP+ community is to succeed in improving the
sustainability of its working practices, then the environment and
related issues of social justice must be recognised as integral parts of
the planning and management of our research activities. With this in
mind, we collect below a list of recommendations for structural changes
to the organisation of our community, our training and our professional
development.</p>
<p>These recommendations complement those listed in the discussions of
specific sources of environmental impacts of HECAP+ research on which
the bulk of this document focuses. Together, these provide concrete
suggestions of ways in which the HECAP+ community can act to reduce its
negative climate and ecological impacts, and address issues of social
justice in line with the United Nations Sustainability Goals, discussed
in the next subsection.</p>

<p>As a global research community, HECAP+ has an impact on society all
over the world. We contribute to basic scientific knowledge, drive
innovation and promote international collaboration. Our institutions are
large employers, large consumers of goods and services, and a key
resource in the training and development of national skills bases. This
places our institutions in a position to influence policy decisions,
drive investment in local infrastructure, and leverage wider
improvements to social and environmental standards. For these reasons,
the HECAP+ community is in a strong position to support the UN
Sustainable Development Goals (<span data-acronym-label="sdg"

<p>The topics discussed in this document are meant to support a
multiplicity of these goals, and we aim to signpost the influence of our
work in all aspects. The goals are listed below, with examples of how
each is impacted by the HECAP+ research community and its work. The SDGs
are defined in UN resolution A/RES/70/1 in detail <span class="citation"

<p>Computing represents an integral part of basic research, being used
for theoretical modelling, simulation (including lattice simulation),
and data analysis. With increasing data sets and demands for accuracy,
computing resource consumption is expected to rise. This poses concerns
in the context of climate sustainability. Within <span

High-Luminosity phase of the Large Hadron Collider (<span
data-acronym-label="hl-lhc"

operational from the end of this decade, will require 5 to 10 times the

with data storage needs reaching about ten exabytes <span
class="citation" data-cites="ATLAS_Computing_HLLHC_Roadmap">[32]</span>.
At the same time, some lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD)
calculations, applied, e.g., to studying heavy quark decays and
anomalous magnetic moments, can be too expensive to pursue, even if
approximately 10% of open-science super-computing in the United States
is devoted to such studies <span class="citation"

<h2 data-number="2.1" id="subsec:hardware"><span
class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Hardware</h2>
<p>When considering the future of sustainability in HECAP+, the hardware
aspect of computing is of great concern. Hardware is both energy- and
resource-consuming. The manufacture, transport, energy consumption, and
disposal of each piece of hardware contribute substantially to the
environmental footprint of the HPC that HECAP+ relies on to analyse
large swathes of data.</p>
<p>Manufacture is the largest source of hardware GHG emissions, with
primarily fossil-fuel-powered manufacturing chains contributing as much
as 80–85% of lifetime emissions of a personal computing device <span
class="citation" data-cites="Greenpeace_Oeko OxfordLCA">[34],
[35]</span>. Moreover, production is notoriously
resource-intensive <span class="citation"
data-cites="Greenpeace_Oeko">[34]</span>, with the mining of the
necessary metals and ‘conflict’ minerals responsible for a number of
negative environmental and social effects. Improper disposal of
substances found in computing equipment is also linked to environmental
hazards and a variety of other risks. For an in-depth discussion, see
Section <a href="#sec:Waste" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:Waste">7</a>.</p>
<p>One way to mitigate the impact due to production is by purchasing
modular equipment, which allows for easy upgrades and repurposing of
hardware. In fact, the extension of hardware lifetime has been
increasingly demonstrated to have major benefits over upgrading to more
efficient technology. A study by the University of Edinburgh Department
for Social Responsibility and Sustainability <span class="citation"
data-cites="UniEd">[36]</span> found that simply using 174 computer
monitors for six years instead of four saved 33 <span
data-acronym-label="tco2e"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">tco2e</span>, which, when
incorporated into standard practice, would not only reduce purchasing
costs, but would result in annual GHG savings of 380 <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{tCO}_2\mathrm{e}\)</span>. It is also
crucial that institutions be able and willing to support repairs. This
applies in particular to personal equipment, e.g., laptops, which come
with additional peripherals such as display, keyboard, and housing, as
compared with HPC units in data centres.</p>
<p>Furthermore, prioritising suppliers that implement sustainable
sourcing, including recovery of secondary materials, and manufacturing
methods would partially mitigate the resource burden, as would enabling
circularity and appropriate E-waste recycling. As one example, TCO
certification <span class="citation"
data-cites="TCO_Certified">[37]</span> is the world-leading
sustainability certification for IT products, such as those supplied by
Lenovo, Dell, or Acer. TCO-certified compliance is independently
verified both pre- and post-certification. TCO certification also covers
data centre products, which could be given preference over uncertified
ones for cluster computing. For more information on sustainable
procurement, including some hallmarks of sustainability in raw materials
supply chains, see Section <a href="#subsec:Resources"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="subsec:Resources">7.1</a>. For
further discussion of E-waste, see Section <a href="#subsec:Waste"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="subsec:Waste">7.2</a>.</p>
<p>A secondary source of hardware emissions is energy consumption during
its use <span class="citation" data-cites="Greenpeace_Oeko">[34]</span>,
with the majority coming from processors, memory, and runtime of jobs.
Processor upgrades and the optimisation of memory type can greatly
reduce energy consumption. See Case Study <a href="#case:LHCb"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="case:LHCb">[case:LHCb]</a> for
details of energy-efficient hardware purchase at the LHCb experiment at
CERN.</p>
<p>It is important to ensure ‘energy proportionality’ in hardware use,
i.e., that energy consumption is proportional to computing performance
over the full range of applications <span class="citation"
data-cites="energy-prop-computing">[38]</span>. Often, hardware designed
to be most efficient at maximum performance load in practice spends most
of its time idle, or performing less intensive computations. This can be
addressed by, e.g., running jobs at high utilization rate on as few
servers as possible.</p>
<p>Implementing parallelisation within processors can also reduce the
number of processors needed, and by replacing central processing units
(<span data-acronym-label="cpu"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">cpu</span>) with graphics processing
units (<span data-acronym-label="gpu"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">gpu</span>), the energy usage can be
reduced. For certain tasks relevant to HECAP+ applications, other even
more specialised processors are available, such as Google’s tensor
processing unit (TPU) <span class="citation"
data-cites="Tensor">[39]</span>. This consumes less power than its
predecessors, although it suffers from poor energy proportionality: at
10% load, it consumes almost 90% of the power it would consume at 100%
load <span class="citation"
data-cites="TensorPerformance">[40]</span>.</p>
<p>However, it should always be tested whether parallelisation does
reduce the overall energy usage of a task, as an increase in energy
consumption per second could counteract the benefits of reduced runtime.
Another aspect to take into consideration when implementing
parallelisation is the particular application, and its requirements in
terms of memory, scalability, and data access. Reference <span
class="citation" data-cites="Abdurachmanov:2014xka">[41]</span>
discusses these issues in the context of the Worldwide Large Hadron
Collider Computing Grid (WLCG). It also gives suggestions for
power-aware software applications and scheduling that could reduce power
consumption. Some of the advocated changes are software specific and are
further detailed in Section <a href="#subsec:software"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="subsec:software">2.2</a>. The
Green500 list <span class="citation" data-cites="GreenList">[42]</span>
ranks the most energy efficient high-performance computing systems. The
GHG emissions of the computer centres that house them, however, depend
critically on their infrastructure. This aspect is further discussed
in Section <a href="#subsec:infrastructure" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="subsec:infrastructure">2.3</a>.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.2" id="subsec:software"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Software</h2>
<p>Software is integral to the work of HECAP+. It underpins how the
global HECAP+ community communicates, shares data, produces papers and
graphics, and acquires, manages, processes and analyses huge amounts of
data from experiments, observatories and simulations.</p>
<p>It is therefore pivotal that the software developed and used by the
HECAP+ community is efficient in order to minimise CPU hours, and to
facilitate data sharing and long-term reproducibility. This requires a
balance to be struck between portability and optimisation for particular
architectures. While not directly linked to environmental
sustainability, initiatives focused on software sustainability in
HECAP+, such as the Institution for Research and Innovation in Software
for High Energy Physics (IRIS-HEP) <span class="citation"
data-cites="IRISHEP">[43]</span> and the <span data-acronym-label="hep"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">hep</span> Software Foundation <span
class="citation" data-cites="HSF">[44]</span>, may provide an important
platform for accelerating the inclusion of environmental considerations
in software development. Doing so is compatible with the FAIR
principles <span class="citation" data-cites="FAIR">[45]</span> for
scientific data management, that software (and data) should be Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable.</p>
<p>Much of the code used in HECAP+ computing relies on libraries and
public codes. Experiments use general frameworks and software
infrastructure provided by experts in the experiments. They can have a
tremendous impact on the energy efficiency of the employed code and, in
some cases, work to meet strict requirements posed by the computing
environment. Decisions on the computing language employed can be
crucial, with Fortran and C++ specifically suited for numerical
calculations, whilst others prioritise convenience or readability over
performance. Changes in processor architecture have been utilised
through dedicated and collaborative efforts, leading to a factor of 2
improvement in the performance (and energy efficiency) of the
reconstruction code of the ATLAS experiment at CERN <span
class="citation" data-cites="ATL-SOFT-PUB-2021-002">[46]</span>. Other
examples of software improvement are recent changes to the software
framework and architecture at LHCb (see Case Study <a href="#case:LHCb"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="case:LHCb">[case:LHCb]</a>)
and improvements in a Monte Carlo (MC) generator core code, having led
to an improvement in speed of a factor of 50 (see Best Practice <a
href="#CS:SoftwareOptimisation" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="CS:SoftwareOptimisation">[CS:SoftwareOptimisation]</a>).
In the case of cosmological analyses, it has been suggested that the
Likelihood Inference Neural Network Accelerator (LINNA) can lead to
efficiency increases that would save $300,000 in energy costs and around
2,200 <span data-acronym-label="tco2"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">tco2</span> in first-year Rubin
Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) analyses <span
class="citation" data-cites="To:2022ubu">[47]</span>.</p>
<p>Sustainable use of software can also be encouraged at an individual
level. The energy used in a job directly correlates with the memory
assigned/available for a job, so mitigation by individuals can be easily
implemented through assigning the correct memory used and by optimising
code <span class="citation" data-cites="Karayakin">[48]</span>. Further
examples of conscientious use of software include limiting resolution or
precision to that which is necessary, effective testing to avoid wasted
CPU hours, good practice in data retention to avoid data loss and the
need to rerun analysis or simulations, and scheduling CPU hours when a
higher percentage of the local energy mix is from renewables.</p>

<p><span><strong>Best Practice : Optimization of software<span

A targeted effort enabled by the UK-based SoftWare and InFrastructure
Technology for High Energy Physics (SWIFT-HEP) <span class="citation"
data-cites="SWIFTHEP">[49]</span> project recently brought together
experimentalists and Monte Carlo (MC) developers to greatly improve the
computational efficiency of multi-leg next to leading order calculations
by focussing on two major components of general purpose MC event
generators: The evaluation of parton-distribution functions along with
the generation of perturbative matrix elements. A dedicated CPU
profiling illustrated that for the cost-driving event samples employed
by the ATLAS experiment at CERN to model irreducible Standard Model
backgrounds, these components dominate the overall run time by up to
80%. Improved interpolation and caching strategies in LHAPDF <span
class="citation" data-cites="Buckley:2014ana">[50]</span>, the main
evaluation tool for parton-distribution functions used by the
experiments, along with the introduction of a simplified pilot run in
the MC generator Sherpa <span class="citation"
data-cites="Sherpa">[51]</span> for the unweighting achieves a reduction
of the computing footprint by factors of around 50 for multi-leg next to
leading order event generation, while maintaining the formal accuracy of
the event sample <span class="citation"
data-cites="Bothmann:2022thx">[52]</span>. The speed-up translates into
a direct CPU (and hence energy) saving, paving the way towards
affordable and sustainable state-of-the-art event simulation in the
<span data-acronym-label="hl-lhc"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">hl-lhc</span> era.</p>
</div>
<h2 data-number="2.3" id="subsec:infrastructure"><span
class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Infrastructure</h2>
<p>Even the most energy-efficient data centres are not environmentally
sustainable if they are powered by carbon-based fuels <span
class="citation" data-cites="Bloom:2022gux">[27]</span>. However,
provided energy from renewable sources is available, this can be easily
addressed. Indeed, there are many advantages to doing so, owing to the
flexibility of HTC. Inherent fluctuations in supply of electricity from
renewables can be managed using a smart queueing system that runs jobs
at times where electricity has a large renewable component, or directs
them to data centres where this is the case. Moreover, a carefully
managed HTC system can even help stabilise fully-renewable power grids
in response to local imbalances in supply and demand: an instantaneous
reduction in the CPU clock frequency by up to 60% ensures per-second
grid stabilisation, and a similar technique can be employed on longer
time scales, e.g., hourly, in response to changes in the carbon
intensity of electricity (or equivalently, market price). For longer
periods, with higher latency, this can also involve powering down nodes.
The reduced work can be compensated by operating older hardware longer,
but only when the electricity price is low. See Section <a
href="#sec:Ene-Transition" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:Ene-Transition">3.1</a> for further discussion of
renewables-based grid infrastructure.</p>
<p>Another source of GHG emissions associated with computing is the
construction and operation of the large data centres within which IT
equipment is housed. Although emissions due to construction can be
significant, particularly if concrete is used, our focus in the
remainder of the section will be on cooling the facilities and
equipment, which is responsible, on average, for almost one third of
facility power use. A judicious choice of location for the centre can
minimise these energy costs, by provision of a cooler external
environment, or other means to cool efficiently. Proximity to a large
body of water, e.g., could make water cooling an attractive option. Care
must be taken, however, to ensure minimal disruption to the natural
environment. Waste heat from the data centre can also be reused to heat
nearby infrastructure. For examples of best practice in data centre
design and construction, see Best Practice <a href="#BP:CSCS"

<span>Information taken from CSCS fact sheets <span class="citation"

The Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS) is a three-floor
concrete building in Lugano that houses the “Piz Daint” supercomputer
and the system used by MeteoSwiss for weather predictions, among other
things. It currently operates at a Power Usage Effectiveness (<span
data-acronym-label="pue" data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">pue</span>)
rating of 1.20 at 25% of full load, with a design PUE of 1.25. At CSCS,
high-efficiency cooling is achieved with a state-of-the art cooling
system using the water from Lake Lugano, extracted at a depth of 45 m
and a temperature of 6C. 420 litres of this water per second are pumped
to the facility over a distance of 2.8 km into large heat exchangers,
where it meets and cools the water in the internal cooling circuit for
the supercomputers. The resulting warmer water is then sent to a heat
exchanger in a second cooling circuit, which cools the components with a
lower thermal sensitivity, as well as the building itself in the summer,
before being returned to the lake. The return flow of water falling back
into the lake is used to produce electricity via a microturbine in the
pumping station further reducing the power consumption of the pumps by
30%. Due to modular cooling and room concepts, the different parts of
the facility are equipped only as necessary. Not only does this reduce
the initial budgetary outlay, but it also results in increased
flexibility to react to future hardware needs, while keeping the PUE
close to its final design value from the outset.</p>

<p><span><strong>Best Practice : <span id="BP:Prevessin"
label="BP:Prevessin"></span>Sustainable design for Prevessin Computing
Centre (PCC), CERN<br />
<span>Edited contribution from Wayne Salter, IT Project Manager for the
PCC.</span></strong></span><br />
<span data-acronym-label="cern"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">cern</span> has for some time been
wishing to build a second Data Centre (DC) on its Prévessin site (named
the PCC) to augment the capacity being provided by its Meyrin DC, in
particular in light of the increased demands from the LHC experiments in
the HL-LHC era. In 2019, a project was approved to build a turn-key DC
with an initial capacity for computing of 4 MW, but with the possibility
to upgrade the IT capacity in two steps to 8 MW and finally to 12 MW. A
Call for Tender was initiated at the end of 2019 for the design,
construction and 10-year operation and maintenance of a new DC, and the
result of the tender was adjudicated at the CERN Finance Committee in
December 2020 in favour of a consortium led by EQUANS <span
class="citation" data-cites="EQUANS">[55]</span>. A contract was signed
with the winning consortium in July 2021 and construction began at the
beginning of 2022. The DC is expected to be operational in the final
quarter of 2023. An important aspect included in the thinking for the
new DC was sustainability and, in particular, energy efficiency. As
such, the specification required a target <span data-acronym-label="pue"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">pue</span> of 1.1, but contractually
allows for a PUE of no worse than 1.15, for energy recuperation of at
least 25% of the heat generated by the IT equipment and for a roof with
vegetation.</p>
<p>When considering the increased energy efficiency compared with CERN’s
existing Meyrin DC, which now has a PUE of around 1.5 after many years
of efforts to bring this down, this equates to significant energy
savings. Assuming the PCC running at full first-phase capacity of 4 MW
with a PUE of 1.1, cf. 1.5 for the current CERN Data Centre, then the
annual saving in terms of electricity would be 14 GWh. Obviously, should
the PCC eventually be upgraded and used at its full final capacity then
the savings could be tripled, cf. with running a similar capacity with
the PUE of the current Meyrin DC. It should be noted that the PUE of the
current data centre is the result of many years of efforts to improve
the energy efficiency, which have substantially reduced its PUE, but
that further improvements would now be complex and costly.</p>
<p>In addition to aiming for high energy efficiency, the design of the
PCC also allows for the heat produced by the IT equipment to be
recuperated and used to help power a new building heating plant that
will soon be built close to the PCC to replace an existing ageing and
inefficient heating plant. The specification for the PCC required the
possibility to recover a minimum of 25% of the generated heat per phase,
implying 1.3 MW per phase leading to a total of 3 MW once the full 12 MW
configuration would be operational. However, during the design phase, it
has been decided to request 3 MW already during the first phase. In the
second phase, the heat recuperation will be increased to 4 MW.</p>
<p>During hot weather, water is sprayed on the heat exchanger elements
of the dry coolers to improve their efficiency. In the original design,
this water was lost, resulting in a non-insignificant water consumption
over the year. However, with sustainability and environmental protection
considerations in mind, it was decided to make efforts to reduce the
water consumption as far as possible without impacting the efficiency of
the cooling solution. As such, it was agreed with the contractor to
change the design to include water re-circulation at the level of the
dry coolers and hence substantially to reduce the water consumption. In
the first phase, the annual water consumption is estimated to be reduced
by almost 60% from 21,455 <span class="math inline">\({\rm m}^3\)</span>
to 8,645 <span class="math inline">\({\rm m}^3\)</span>, based on the
average meteorological data for the area.</p>
<p>To further improve sustainability and to make the building more
ecologically friendly, it was decided to request that vegetation be
planted on the roof of the building, which is effectively in two halves.
The first half contains the IT rooms (two per floor for three floors)
and the second half is for all the technical rooms. The roof is
similarly split in two. The first half is used for the dry coolers and
associated technical infrastructure and hence cannot be used for
vegetation, but the second half will be planted with grass covering an
area of approximately 1,250 <span class="math inline">\({\rm

<span>Edited contribution from Tetyana Galatyuk on behalf of KHuK

At GSI Helmholtzzentrum für Schwerionenforschung in Darmstadt, the
Green-IT Cube <span class="citation"
data-cites="GreenITCube">[56]</span> was constructed in 2014 to host the
computing systems of the FAIR particle accelerator facility under
construction close to GSI, as well as numerous other scientific
computing systems. It has a total capacity of 12 MW and 768 racks,
distributed over 6 floors. The partial <span data-acronym-label="pue"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">pue</span>, that is the PUE across
some part of the data centre,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> of the installation
reaches 1.07 at a load of less than 25%, which meets the design value.
In acceptance testing at higher loads an even better partial PUE has
been observed.</p>
<p>This became possible due to the award-winning innovative design of
the Green-IT Cube, which was developed at the Frankfurt Institute of
Advanced Studies by Volker Lindenstruth. The innovative design based on
water cooled back-door heat exchangers allowed not only for a low PUE,
but also for an advanced 3D building design, which reduced the ground
print of the compact data center. At the same time, it reduced the
building material needed, further reducing the environmental impact.
Parts of the excess heat are used to heat office buildings on the GSI
campus.</p>
<p>The patented design has received many innovation and data center
awards and was successfully transferred into industry.</p>

<p>The operation of experimental equipment and computing facilities at
large-scale research centres has a significant energy footprint. In
addition, energy is required for the construction and disassembly of
infrastructure, for heating and cooling buildings, and for transport of
goods and people. To comply with the Paris Agreement, future facilities
must be effectively climate-neutral, and this presents a significant
challenge for <span data-acronym-label="hecap"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">hecap</span>.</p>
<p>Particle collider experiments are particularly power-hungry, with the
<span data-acronym-label="lhc"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">lhc</span> at <span
data-acronym-label="cern" data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">cern</span>
being a prominent example. With its particle accelerators, detectors and
extensive infrastructure, CERN consumes up to 1,300 GWh of electricity
annually, of which 55% is due to LHC operations <span class="citation"
data-cites="Environment:2737239 CERNenergymanagement">[1], [58]</span>.
CERN plans to significantly increase the scale of its installations in a
push towards higher energies and intensities. Doing so responsibly will
require a concerted effort to minimise power consumption and increase
the energy efficiency of the infrastructure, and a careful analysis of
how to source the remaining energy needs sustainably.</p>
<p>CERN receives most of its electricity from the French grid, which is
currently characterised by a high share of low-carbon nuclear power,
suppressing its electricity-related <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span> emissions in comparison
with other facilities (see Figure <a
href="#fig:Intro-ComparativeEmissions" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:Intro-ComparativeEmissions">4</a>).<a href="#fn11"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>
However, taking into consideration the decreasing share of nuclear power
in the French grid over the last 15 years, as well as the wider common
European electricity market, where fossil fuels account for 37% of
electricity production on average <span class="citation"
data-cites="BP2022">[59]</span>, the outlook is more worrying.<a
href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>It is important to place the energy needs of HECAP+ research
infrastructure within the context of the world’s necessary and rapid
transition to zero-carbon energy sources. Global primary energy
consumption in 2019 was approximately 160,000 TWh (equivalent to an
average power consumption of 18,000 GW), around 80% of which comes from
<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span>-emitting fossil
fuels <span class="citation" data-cites="OWDfuels">[61]</span>.
Moreover, demand is rising, primarily due to the growth and
industrialisation of emerging countries. A 50% reduction of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span> emissions by 2030, as
stipulated in the Paris Agreement in combination with the latest <span

scenarios (see Figure <a href="#fig:ene-netco2"

must be filled by additional climate-neutral power generation, or by
energy savings and recuperation. Consumption was extrapolated linearly
from 1965–2021 to account for additional demand from emerging countries.

<p>Many experimental technologies such as <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span> capture and storage (CCS)
will not be viable for large-scale implementation within this short time
frame <span class="citation"
data-cites="IPCCMitigationReport">[66]</span>. Filling the energy gap
with solar, wind, and nuclear power requires upscaling existing
facilities by more than an order of magnitude within seven years, a not
inconsiderable task. Therefore, substantial increases in energy
efficiency will be indispensable. Even tripling the output of existing
solar, wind and nuclear installations by 2030 (which may itself be
unrealistic), bridging the fossil energy gap would still require a 40%
global efficiency increase compared to today. Substantial energy savings
requires systemic changes in technology and behaviour, such as
transitioning from combustion engines to electric motors, from gas
heating to heat pumps and from cars to rail. The global situation is
therefore likely to result in energy becoming scarce and expensive in
the coming decades, with the potential to directly limit our
capabilities to conduct energy-intensive experiments and data analysis
in basic research.</p>

<p>Transitioning the energy demands of HECAP+ research to <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span>-neutral sources will likely
require a mix of sources: solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and nuclear
power, many of which will be strongly location dependent. Despite their
relatively low cost (see Figure <a href="#fig:ene-mitigation"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:ene-mitigation">7</a>),
the geographical limitations of renewable energy, combined with the
challenge that significantly increasing the share of nuclear power
presents, (see the paragraph on nuclear power for details), will make a
rapid transition to carbon-neutral energy difficult for HECAP+, and
large-scale transmission or import of sustainable energy may offer a
solution. Alternatively, efforts could be made to site future facilities
near abundant sources of renewable energy, which could have the
additional benefit of contributing to developing economies over a longer
period. The Synchrotron-Light for Experimental Science and Applications
in the Middle East (<span data-acronym-label="sesame"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">sesame</span>) project  <span

<h4 data-number="3.1.0.1" id="solar"><span
class="header-section-number">3.1.0.1</span> Solar</h4>
<p>Solar energy is abundant, and near-universally available. Its
intensity depends on latitude, with the highest efficiencies in the
deserts of the sun belts north and south of the equator. According to a
2021 report by the Carbon Tracker Initiative <span class="citation"
data-cites="CarbonTracker21">[70]</span>, populating an area of only
450,000 km<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span> with solar panels
would be sufficient to satisfy global energy demands. This corresponds
to an area the size of Morocco, two-thirds that of Texas, or 4% of
European landmass.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> According to the IPCC <span
class="citation" data-cites="IPCCMitigationReport">[66]</span>, “The
global technical potential of direct solar energy far exceeds that of
any other renewable energy resource and is well beyond the total amount
of energy needed to support ambitious mitigation over the current
century.” However, large-scale adoption of photovoltaic (PV) panels
poses concerns due to resource use, particularly the energy-intensive
production of silicon used to produce the panels, and end-of-life waste
generation (see Section <a href="#sec:Waste" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:Waste">7</a> for more information). These impacts
can be partially mitigated by material recovery in PV cell recycling,
and their reuse <span class="citation"
data-cites="DANIELAABIGAIL2022103539">[71]</span>.</p>
<p>Solar panels are easily retrofitted onto existing infrastructure, and
their price has dropped by almost 90% in the last two decades.
Unfortunately, solar power can be unavailable when it is needed most: at
night and during winter (in countries at higher latitudes), leading to a
need to increase its efficiency and storage capacity. An overview of
energy storage technologies can be found in Section <a
href="#subsec:grid" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="subsec:grid">3.1.1</a>. See Case Study <a
href="#case:solar" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="case:solar">[case:solar]</a> for a study of the
implementation of in-house solar power at CERN.</p>
<h4 data-number="3.1.0.2" id="wind"><span
class="header-section-number">3.1.0.2</span> Wind</h4>
<p>By comparison with solar energy, wind energy is more sensitive to
local conditions. In Europe, competitive locations for wind energy, with
costs below per kWh, are primarily offshore, and are concentrated along
the coasts of the North and Baltic Seas, the Bay of Biscay, and the
English Channel <span class="citation"
data-cites="EEAWindEnergy">[72]</span>. Landlocked countries, such as
Switzerland or Austria, are generally less suited for production of
energy through wind turbines. Producing 25% of, e.g., Swiss energy
demand from wind power would require populating 100% of its agricultural
farmland with wind turbines (although this does not preclude growing
crops beneath the windmills). By contrast, fulfilling a quarter of
Danish or Estonian energy demand would require less than 4% of the
farmland <span class="citation"
data-cites="EEAWindEnergy">[72]</span>.</p>
<h4 data-number="3.1.0.3" id="hydroelectric"><span
class="header-section-number">3.1.0.3</span> Hydroelectric</h4>
<p>Water power is even more reliant on local conditions, such as high
flows or water volumes and large altitude difference, which naturally
limits its applicability. However, the energy output of hydroelectric
plants is steady, and can be adjusted to demand very quickly, making it
a good complement to other renewable sources. It can also be used for
energy storage, see Section <a href="#subsec:grid"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="subsec:grid">3.1.1</a>. The
largest hydroelectric capacity is in China, which produces almost 30% of
the global hydroelectric power <span class="citation"
data-cites="IHA2021">[73]</span>, thanks to its large projects in the
Yangtze River valleys.</p>
<p>Mega-dams, however, constitute a large intervention on the natural
environment, and consequently come with associated risks, such as
landslides, earthquakes, and destruction of habitats, and can themselves
be a source of the potent <span data-acronym-label="ghg"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">ghg</span> methane when flooded flora
rots. The Three Gorges dam in particular has been controversial both
domestically and abroad <span class="citation"
data-cites="ThreeGorges">[74]</span>. In arid areas, or during periods
of drought, which are expected to become more prevalent due to climate
change, hydroelectric power may be in competition with agricultural
needs, and climate change may jeopardise future yields of existing
dams.</p>
<p>While the potential for marine power generation from ocean currents,
tides, waves, and gradients in salt and temperature (collectively known
as Ocean Energy Technologies) is huge, there is no technology currently
mature enough to produce marine power at large scale <span
class="citation" data-cites="OET">[75]</span>.</p>
<h4 data-number="3.1.0.4" id="geothermal"><span
class="header-section-number">3.1.0.4</span> Geothermal</h4>
<p>Geothermal energy is a stable source of renewable energy. It consists
of residual heat from the time when the Earth was formed and of heat
newly produced inside the Earth due to radioactive decay of hot elements
in the mantle, by tidal forces due to the Moon and Sun, or by friction
along tectonic plate boundaries. Although it has low intensity compared
with solar energy, its technical potential of about <span
class="math inline">\(1.4 \times10^6\)</span> TW-years is around three
times total global energy consumption <span class="citation"
data-cites="Britannica">[76]</span>.</p>
<p>The most easily exploitable is the ‘shallow’ geothermal energy stored
in the upper few metres of the Earth’s surface. This can be employed to
provide space heating or cooling for buildings and urban areas using
buried pipes containing a circulating fluid as a heat exchanger, and a
geothermal heat pump <span class="citation"
data-cites="Narsilio2018">[77]</span>. The low thermal conductivity of
the ground limits the total amount of geothermal heat that can be
exploited and depends strongly on rain and ground water. Modern
geothermal heat pumps use the ground as heat storage and not so much as
heat source. The ground heat that is extracted in winter is regenerated
in summer by using the heat pump for cooling the building.</p>
<p>Geothermal power generation, however, requires higher temperatures.
Easily accessed only in areas of volcanic activity, and along plate
boundaries, much geothermal power-generating potential is locked up
below common drilling depths, where the rock is less porous. Enhanced
Geothermal Systems (EGS) <span class="citation"
data-cites="IRENA2017">[78]</span> induce porosity by fracturing deeper,
hotter rock using high-pressure water injection, to allow for fluid
circulation. This hydrothermal ‘fracking’ has attracted significant
controversy as, in addition to the injection of toxic chemicals into the
Earth, which can then pollute nearby groundwater sources, it brings a
risk of induced seismic activity if unwittingly carried out near a
‘locked’ dormant fault, and was thought to be responsible for triggering
a magnitude-5.4 earthquake in the South Korean city of Pohang in
November 2017 <span class="citation"
data-cites="Kim2018 Grigoli2018">[79], [80]</span>.</p>
<h4 data-number="3.1.0.5" id="nuclear"><span
class="header-section-number">3.1.0.5</span> Nuclear</h4>
<p>Nuclear power is a source of low-carbon electricity. Nevertheless, an
energy source is only termed sustainable if it does not carry any
significant long-term risk for future generations. This definition of
sustainability based on the Brundtland Report <span class="citation"
data-cites="Brundtland">[81]</span> has also been adopted by the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) <span class="citation"
data-cites="IAEA">[82]</span>, which argues for the ‘weak
sustainability’ of nuclear power.</p>
<p>The share of primary energy from nuclear power has been decreasing on
all continents except Asia over the last two decades, and has fallen
below 4% of global primary energy production <span class="citation"
data-cites="OWDnuclear">[83]</span>. According to the IAEA, nuclear
reactors have a median construction time of 93 months <span
class="citation" data-cites="IAEANuclear">[84]</span>, not including
planning and permissions. See Case Study <a href="#cs:nuclear_gap"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="cs:nuclear_gap">[cs:nuclear_gap]</a> for an estimate of
how many nuclear power stations must be constructed to cover global
energy needs.</p>
<p>Safety, security and climate resilience of the reactors, and
availability of fuel, as well as storage of spent fuel, are important
challenges. The exact form these take is crucially dependent on future
technological developments, to which HECAP+ research contributes
directly. Today, several new reactor types are being developed, which
promise to have additional safety features, an efficient use of more
abundant isotopes and less long-lasting nuclear waste. HECAP+ research
can also contribute to non-proliferation efforts, see e.g., Ref. <span
class="citation" data-cites="DUNE:2022jhf">[85]</span>. Bringing
developing technologies to maturity and commercial viability takes time,
and in the near term the IPCC does not assess favourably the mitigation
potential for nuclear energy, see Figure <a href="#fig:ene-mitigation"

Department of Energy <span class="citation"
data-cites="BFE">[90]</span>, it is possible to estimate the solar
potential of these rooftops. Similar public tools are now available for

classified as “optimal” for their orientation towards the sun. The large
rectangular building in the middle is assembly hall 157. The cadastre
lists an estimate of 392 MWh per annum of electricity generation for the
south-west half of this 2,055 m<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>
roof, with the other part capable of producing an additional 335 MWh per
annum. CERN has 653 buildings with a total roof area of 421,000 m<span

<h3 data-number="3.1.1" id="subsec:grid"><span
class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> Renewable grid
infrastructure</h3>
<p>For global power grids to rely more heavily on intermittent sources
of renewable energy, such as wind and solar photovoltaic, assessed as
having the highest climate mitigation potential to 2030 by the IPCC (see
Figure <a href="#fig:ene-mitigation" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:ene-mitigation">7</a>), much of the existing grid
infrastructure and controls will need to be updated to smooth out
fluctuations in supply and demand <span class="citation"
data-cites="PowerGridInertia">[92]</span>. Grid inertia, which acts as a
short-term buffer in fossil-fuel grids in periods where electricity
demand outstrips supply, is significantly lower for intermittent
sources, compromising the stability of the grid. ‘Smart grid’
infrastructure must provide peak-shifting capabilities and fast
frequency response to stabilise electricity supply despite the lower
intrinsic inertia of the grid. It will also need to draw upon a novel
and expanded energy storage capacity to bridge longer-term gaps between
supply and demand <span class="citation"
data-cites="LDESEnergyStorage">[93]</span> (for further discussion, see
below), as well as the capability to regulate bi-directional flow of
electricity, well-suited to the distributed generation of intermittents.
Inverter-based resources with low inertia are ideally suited to
near-instantaneous response <span class="citation"
data-cites="PowerGridInertia">[92]</span>. Electronic control of this
response, coupled with developing ‘grid-forming’ technologies, which
allow inverters to emulate a traditional grid’s stable frequency, as
well as automated demand-side response to voluntarily disconnect
non-critical loads momentarily, have the potential to transform our
existing networks <span class="citation"
data-cites="PowerGridInertia">[92]</span>.</p>
<p>Existing solutions have been utilised successfully in several fully
renewable island microgrids, and on a larger scale in the Electric
Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the smallest of the three power
grids in the United States, which achieved 58% instantaneous wind
penetration in 2019 <span class="citation"
data-cites="PowerGridInertia">[92]</span>. Scaling up these solutions
requires further research, although several highly cited studies argue
for the feasibility of 100% renewable-based grids world-wide at low
cost, eschewing any fossil fuel or nuclear energy component (for a
comprehensive review, see Ref. <span class="citation"
data-cites="HEARD20171122">[94]</span> and also Ref. <span
class="citation" data-cites="BROWN2018834">[95]</span>).</p>
<h4 data-number="3.1.1.1" id="energy-storage"><span
class="header-section-number">3.1.1.1</span> Energy storage</h4>
<p>The feasibility of pure renewable-based grids is crucially dependent
on an increased energy storage capacity to smooth out fluctuations (on
timescales ranging from diurnal to seasonal) in the supply of
intermittent renewables and demand <span class="citation"
data-cites="LDESEnergyStorage">[93]</span>. While the cost of Li-ion
batteries have plummeted 40-fold in the past 35 years <span
class="citation" data-cites="Ziegler_2020">[96]</span>, and
notwithstanding the implications of resource extraction (see, e.g.,
Section <a href="#sec:Waste" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:Waste">7</a>), their development has focused on
short-duration portable energy storage, as driven by needs of the
electric vehicle industry. Projections show that in order to minimise
the costs of a net-zero energy system, storage capacity must increase by
almost an order of magnitude, from 160 GW (and 9 TWh total capacity)
today, to 1.5–2.5 TW (85-140 TWh) globally by 2040 <span
class="citation" data-cites="LDESEnergyStorage">[93]</span>.</p>
<p>Most existing and planned storage capacity is in pumped storage
hydropower, a mechanical form of storage where water pumped into a
reservoir at high elevation turns a turbine as it flows to one at lower
elevation <span class="citation"
data-cites="LDESEnergyStorage">[93]</span>. As well as being
geographically limited, however, these open-air reservoirs suffer the
same environmental problems as other hydropower projects (see discussion
above), and are similarly subject to the vagaries of the climate. A new
promising approach to pump storage is the use of undersea bowls that are
evacuated to store energy which is restored when they are filled up with
water again. An even simpler approach is to build a large ring wall
inside of a deep lake, and empty and refill the internal area using
pump-turbines. This way, pumped-storage hydroelectricity does not
require a separate upper and lower lake, and a single lake is
sufficient. Defunct open pit mines, large natural lakes and even the sea
allow for new opportunities to install large-scale storage devices with
less environmental impact <span class="citation"
data-cites="Dueren pumpstorage">[97], [98]</span>.</p>
<p>Interesting alternatives include storing energy as compressed air; or
as latent heat in, e.g., aluminium alloy <span class="citation"
data-cites="LDESEnergyStorage">[93]</span>. However, there is need for
significant investment in the energy storage sector to bring new ideas,
including novel mechanical, thermal, electrochemical and chemical
storage methods to commercial viability <span class="citation"
data-cites="LDESEnergyStorage">[93]</span>. For more details on capacity
and market-readiness of promising long-duration energy storage methods,

<h3 data-number="3.1.2" id="subsec:import"><span
class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> Energy import and export</h3>
<p>The uneven geographical distribution of sources of renewable energy
leads to the question of whether large-scale import and export of
renewable energy could be a cost-effective way of closing the energy
gap. For Europe, detailed studies have shown that energy import by
cable, as well as by chemical energy carriers, have comparable or lower
costs compared to local energy harvesting <span class="citation"
data-cites="10.1371/journal.pone.0281380">[99]</span>.</p>
<p>Technical options to transport electricity over long distances have
improved significantly in the last decades. In South America and China,
projects to transport electricity over more than 2,000 km by Ultra High
Voltage Direct Current (UHVDC) lines are already operational <span
class="citation" data-cites="Champion">[100]</span>. The Viking Link
UK-Denmark project provides another example <span class="citation"
data-cites="VikingLink">[101]</span>. For a summary of all current and
planned European transmission projects, see Ref. <span class="citation"
data-cites="TYNDP">[102]</span>.</p>
<p>This technological progress opens up an alternative to the
traditional import and export of chemical energy: direct import of
renewable electricity, e.g., from Northern Africa to Europe <span
class="citation" data-cites="Dueren Dueren+2011+263+275">[97],
[103]</span>. An excellent potential for electricity generation by solar
and wind power, large unused tracts of land, and existing energy trade
partnerships for fossil fuels make North African countries ideal export
partners for procuring electricity from sustainable sources. Indeed, the
Xlinks Morocco-UK Power Project <span class="citation"
data-cites="Xlinks">[104]</span> aims to connect a solar and wind energy
facility in Morocco’s Guelmim Oued Noun region to the UK energy grid by
3,800 km HVDC sub-sea cables by 2030.</p>
<p>While the import and export of energy is a promising solution on the
technical and economic level, constructing wind or solar farms, e.g., in
the sun belts of Africa, to then export the power to Europe involves
geopolitical and social considerations. Resource and person-power
extraction from Africa to the benefit of Europe and America has a long,
reprehensible colonial history. It is of the utmost importance to make
fair power trade agreements between the continents that ensure strong
integration into local communities and include the local population in
the planning and implementation of such projects and related
infrastructure. In this way, a win-win situation for all stakeholders
should be ensured, and well-planned cooperation has the potential to act
in a geopolitically stabilizing way in line with the 16th and 17th UN
<span data-acronym-label="sdg"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">sdg</span>s ("peace, justice and
strong institutions" and "partnership for the goals"). If achievable,
equitable import and export of renewable energy could be considered as
part of a catalogue of solutions to cover future global energy
needs.</p>
<p>The HECAP+ communities have a record of successful collaboration
between nations, and they could therefore be important players in
proving the viability of such partnerships. One possible scenario for
the transmission of solar energy is detailed in Case Study <a
href="#case:desert" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="case:desert">[case:desert]</a>.</p>
<div class="marginline">
<p><span><strong>Case Study : CERN-LINK — Clean power from the

The <span data-acronym-label="hecap"

data-acronym-label="cern" data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">cern</span>
in particular, has a long history of effective cooperation across
geographical and socio-political boundaries, in the pursuit of science.
CERN brought scientists from East and West together during the Cold War,
and Arabic and Israeli people together for the <span
data-acronym-label="sesame"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">sesame</span> project, the first
accelerator laboratory powered by solar energy from the desert <span
class="citation" data-cites="Sesame">[67]</span>. This makes CERN
ideally placed to spearhead a project to import energy from countries
rich in renewable energy sources, and transport it across international
boundaries. This type of spin-off could help cover CERN’s energy needs,
while also reinforcing the idea that fundamental research has the
potential to solve problems outside its immediate purview in new and
innovative ways.</p>
<p>The technology for long-distance energy transmission, in the form of
High-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) lines, is commercially available, and
is being increasingly employed to transport energy from renewable-rich
to renewable-poor regions. Prominent examples include the Viking Link
UK-Denmark project, which broke ground in July 2020 <span
class="citation" data-cites="VikingLink">[101]</span>, as well as the
planned XLinks Morocco-UK power project <span class="citation"
data-cites="Xlinks">[104]</span>.</p>
<p>Even so, it is of paramount importance that fair power trade
agreements be put in place to ensure mutual benefit to all stakeholders,
including the local communities hosting the energy-harvesting
infrastructure. It is also important to acknowledge that additional
environmental considerations are required when planning and implementing
a project of this type, in terms of minimising the impacts on local
ecosystems, as well as the marine environments across which the
underwater cables would be installed.</p>

<p>A scenario for connecting, e.g., Morocco, Algeria or Tunisia to
Southern France, Spain or Italy by sub-sea cable is plausible from a
technological point of view (for a detailed feasibility study, see
Ref. <span class="citation" data-cites="MoroccoHVDV">[106]</span>), and
could be employed for HECAP+ applications (see Figure <a
href="#fig:ene-cernlink" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:ene-cernlink">9</a>). Costs are estimated to be
around /kWh for a year-round power supply of 3.6 GW in the daytime and
2.2 GW at night <span class="citation"
data-cites="Dueren Dueren+2011+263+275 Hampp">[97], [103], [107]</span>.
This estimate includes infrastructure costs for generating the
electricity, buffer storage and transmission line costs. Feasibility and
cost estimates agree well with those for previously proposed commercial
projects <span class="citation" data-cites="Xlinks">[104]</span>.</p>
<p>Electricity import on this scale would exceed the power needs of
CERN, and surplus power could be returned to the European electricity
grid to power other research institutions and universities that join the
initiative. Southern France is well-suited to the role of import
terminal for electricity due to its pre-existing grid infrastructure, as
well as its proximity to CERN and other major research institutions.</p>

<h2 data-number="3.2" id="sec:Ene-Saving"><span
class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Energy Saving and
Recuperation</h2>
<p>A first step in reducing energy usage is energy monitoring, which
will allow us to assess where improvements are needed. The best energy
saving measures will be individual to each location and facility, making
it hard to recommend specific actions here, although insulating
buildings and ensuring that the heating/ cooling systems are maximally
efficient are universally applicable measures. For an example of energy
recuperation in the context of basic research, see Best Practice <a
href="#BP:DESY_recycling" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="BP:DESY_recycling">[BP:DESY_recycling]</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the energy budget for many high energy experiments is due to
the accelerators and detectors. Initiatives to reduce their energy use
are many and varied. Relevant references for detectors are collected in
Section <a href="#sec:Technology" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:Technology">6</a>, see also the discussion on energy
saving in the LHCb experiment at CERN in Case Study <a href="#case:LHCb"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="case:LHCb">[case:LHCb]</a>. A
particularly impressive example of energy-efficient accelerator design
is the Energy Recovery Linac Test Accelerator (CBETA) <span
class="citation" data-cites="Bartnik:2020pos">[108]</span>, based in
Cornell. This accelerator saves energy, both by recovering the energy of
the bunched particles to accelerate the next batch, and by using
permanent magnets to guide the particle beam. See Best Practice <a

<p><span><strong>Best Practice : Recycling energy at DESY<span

For existing experiments, where minimising energy usage was not a factor
in the design process, it is still possible to save energy retroactively
through recycling of energy/heat. Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron in
Hamburg (<span data-acronym-label="desy"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">desy</span>) is currently using the
waste heat, which is generated by condensation of the helium that is
used to cool the accelerator, to heat their buildings. This saves 7.5
GWh a year, which is approximately a third of the heat energy used on
campus <span class="citation" data-cites="DESY">[109]</span>. Together
with the University for Applied Sciences in Hamburg, they are also
investigating the potential for recycling waste heat from other sources,
e.g., the many magnets used in the accelerator. First results suggest
that it should be sufficient to heat all buildings on campus in this
way <span class="citation"

<p>Over a quarter of global <span data-acronym-label="ghg"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">ghg</span> emissions comes from food
production <span class="citation" data-cites="USEPA">[111]</span>, and a
quarter of this food is lost in the supply chain, or discarded by
consumers <span class="citation"
data-cites="Searchinger2018">[112]</span>. Plant and animal agriculture
also has extensive and profound negative impacts on the environment
through land use, freshwater use and pollution, and terrestrial
acidification.</p>
<p>A recent article in <em>Science</em> argued that limiting warming to
1.5C will not be possible without “ambitious changes to food systems”
even if fossil fuel emissions are immediately halted <span
class="citation" data-cites="Clark370">[113]</span>. The most impactful
change reported in the study is a global switch to the healthy,
plant-rich diet recommended by the EAT-Lancet commission <span
class="citation" data-cites="WILLETT2019447">[114]</span>, which is one
that can be implemented immediately, and on an individual level.
Supplementing this with measures such as reducing food waste and
increasing efficiencies in food production could result in a net
carbon-neutral food system by 2100 <span class="citation"
data-cites="Clark370">[113]</span>. While sourcing sustainably-grown
food and ‘eating local’ can have a positive impact on food-related
emissions (of which transportation is responsible for 6%, see Figure <a
href="#fig:food_impact" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:food_impact">10</a>), the largest impact can be
achieved by reducing the consumption of high-methane emitters, such as
beef, lamb and dairy <span class="citation"
data-cites="PooreNemecek2018 OWID-Sustainable OWID-Local Scarborough2023">[115]–[117],
<strong>OWID-Sustainable?</strong></span>.</p>
<p>However, choices related to the food that we eat are deeply personal
and often loaded with cultural and social significance. As such, it is
important to acknowledge that changes to food systems will be a gradual
process and will not have a ‘one size fits all’ solution. Their
equitable implementation will require cross-disciplinary analysis of the
implications of such changes for all stakeholders. This includes
producers and the local populations to which they belong, and steps must
be taken to ensure communities are empowered and resilient to multiple
overlapping pressures, from climate change and markets <span
class="citation" data-cites="WalshDilley2020">[118]</span>. The
devastating impact of the quinoa boom and bust on pastoral communities
in Bolivia provides one well-documented example <span class="citation"
data-cites="WalshDilley2020 Rodas2021">[118], [119]</span>. Moreover,
such changes must account for global disparities in wealth, and the
variations in availability and access to food sources, to avoid further
cementing geographic inequalities in diet. Notwithstanding the care that
these factors necessitate, a significant proportion of the
HECAP+ community is in the privileged position to be able to reduce
their consumption of animal-derived food products and minimise food
waste.</p>

with total mammal biomass dominated by humans and their livestock <span
class="citation" data-cites="Bar-On6506">[121]</span>.</p>
<p>Animal agriculture is responsible for just over half of GHG emissions
from the food sector, due to direct emissions from livestock and
fisheries, land use, and production of crops for animal consumption.<a
href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"

<p>Shifting consumption away from animal products to a more plant-based

<p>Several universities and other institutes for higher education have

changing the cafeteria layout, and modifying default meal options and
food labelling <span class="citation"

<p>At conferences and workshops, the primary purpose of any food served
is to create additional opportunities for attendees to mingle and
discuss. As such, conference organisers enjoy more leeway to make
sustainable food choices the default option for these short-term,
small-scale events. Best Practice <a href="#catering_bp"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="catering_bp">[catering_bp]</a>
contains two examples of successful physics conferences with plant-based
catering. They highlight, among other things, the importance of
institutional partnerships with plant-friendly caterers, and organisers
should push for these if they do not already exist. For further
discussion on sustainability at conferences, see Section <a

<p>In, e.g., the week beginning 27 June 2022, beef, fish and seafood
were each served three times as the primary component of the meal, veal
once, poultry five times, and fish twice. We assume that these
distributions are representative of a typical weekly menu at R1 and that
the beef originated from beef-herd cows. The GHG emissions of the
various forms of protein are shown in Figure <a

The Women in Physics Canada Conference 2019 <span class="citation"
data-cites="WIPC">[140]</span> at McGill University in Montréal was
designed as a ‘sustainable’ conference. Ecologically-friendly choices
were made by offering purely plant-based catering, sustainable goodie
bags, and use of reusable tableware (see also Section <a
href="#sec:CateringTableware" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:CateringTableware">7.2.3</a>). Most of the feedback
regarding these measures was positive. An important point for the
organisers was to advertise the catering as sustainable, and not only as
vegan, since according to their experience this “helped the way the
catering was received” by the participants. The organisers mentioned
that it can be difficult to find a vegan caterer if the only choices are
partners of the university hosting the conference, but it was
nevertheless possible in their case.<br />
The ‘Young Researchers Integrability School and Workshop (YRISW) 2019: A
modern primer for 2D CFT’ <span class="citation"
data-cites="YRISW">[141]</span> in Vienna offered only plant-based
catering. The organisers of the school selected this option as the “most
inclusive approach”, where people are not separated according to their
eating habits. They wanted to advertise plant-based food to the
participants, and “reduce the environmental impact of the event”. The
limited food options also reduced the total cost of the catering. The
organisers received positive feedback, not only for the food itself but
also for the “effort to reduce the ecological impact of the school”. The
organisers emphasised the importance of finding a specialist plant-based
caterer to ensure the quality and flavour of the food.</p>

<p>Mobility constitutes a significant portion of the emissions of a
<span data-acronym-label="hecap"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">hecap</span> researcher. This
includes short daily commutes between the home and the workplace, and
longer-distance business travel (see Figure <a
href="#fig:Intro-ComparativeEmissions" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:Intro-ComparativeEmissions">4</a>).</p>
<p>Transport accounted for almost a fifth of total global emissions in
2016 <span class="citation" data-cites="OWIDsector">[142]</span>, and is
the sector that saw the highest growth in pre-COVID years <span
class="citation" data-cites="SLOCAT">[143]</span>. Demand for car, rail
and air transport is expected to continue to increase over time with
increasing global population and income levels.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, self-powered mobility, such as walking and cycling,
are the most carbon-efficient means of transportation, with train travel
being the next best. A quantitative comparison between these and other
options requires further details to be specified, such as the distance
travelled, the fuel efficiency of the vehicle used and the number of
passengers carried, and the underlying electricity mix for the country
of travel. In the UK, for instance, driving alone in a medium-sized
petrol-fuelled car yields smaller <span data-acronym-label="ghg"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">ghg</span> emissions than air travel
for distances shorter than 1,000 km, whereas flying in economy class
beats driving over longer distances <span class="citation"
data-cites="OWIDtravel">[144]</span> (data taken from Ref. <span
class="citation" data-cites="BEIS">[145]</span>).<a href="#fn21"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>
For a detailed comparison of emissions due to various forms of transport
within France, see Figure <a href="#fig:emiMobility"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:emiMobility">13</a>.</p>
<p>When and how we travel, however, are not always free choices, being
constrained by existing transport infrastructure, local geography, our
research, finances, and caring responsibilities. Universities and
HECAP+ institutions, with their large and progressive workforce, can
help tip the balance in favour of the more environmentally sustainable
option with a judicious combination of policy, incentives, on-site
infrastructure and advocacy.</p>
<p>Our current societal infrastructure is set up to facilitate
individual travel by car, to the detriment of a large part of the
population. Universities, as large employers with a relatively
progressive workforce, have the potential to act as instigators of
change in this. Making public transport and cycling the preferred
options when possible will increase demand for these more sustainable
forms of transport and thus encourage cities to improve the
infrastructure for them.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, efforts to limit emissions resulting from travel must
be balanced against legitimate needs for mobility: the establishing and
maintenance of close collaborative relationships, sharing of research
outputs, individual exposure and career development, and travel to
research facilities. Changes to our travel culture and policies must be
implemented so as to benefit and, at the very least, not to worsen
barriers to inclusion, by avoiding the disenfranchisement of members of
our community such as early-career researchers, members of our community
from the Global South or those otherwise geographically isolated.</p>

<h2 data-number="5.1" id="commuting"><span
class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Commuting</h2>
<p>Changes in commuting patterns are typically affected by life
circumstances, including changes in education, employment and
residence <span class="citation" data-cites="BEIGE2017179">[146]</span>.
The viability of environmentally sustainable mobility, like walking,
cycling and taking the train, depends crucially on characteristics of
the home and workplace locations, including the distance between them,
and their local environment. These properties are seen to influence the
relative importance of commuting and business emissions for different
HECAP+ institutions.</p>
<p>For example, <span data-acronym-label="cern"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">cern</span>, <span
data-acronym-label="fnal"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">fnal</span>, and the Department of
Physics at <span data-acronym-label="eth"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">eth</span> have wildly different
<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span> emission profiles due
to personal transportation. While emissions due to commuting were
roughly equal to those for business travel at FNAL, commuting outweighed
business travel for CERN, and conversely, business travel swamped
commuting emissions for ETHZ. This reflects the unique environment and
characteristics of each these research centres:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>ETHZ is located in an urban centre and is well connected to the
local public transport. In 2008, only 1,700 <span
data-acronym-label="tco2e"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">tco2e</span> were recorded for
commuting, with 7.5 to 10 times larger emissions attributable to
business travel (using numbers from 2006–2012). It is clear here that
the emissions per capita for all staff (including researchers) are
significantly smaller than those for FNAL or CERN.</p></li>
<li><p>FNAL and CERN have more rural settings, with a 77% majority of
CERN employees commuting by car from France. FNAL’s commuter
emissions <span class="citation"
data-cites="FermilabEnvReport">[22]</span> of about 6,000 <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{tCO}_2\mathrm{e}\)</span> are
approximately on par with business travel emissions,<a href="#fn22"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a>
whilst CERN quotes 5,836 <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{tCO}_2\mathrm{e}\)</span> of commuter
emissions compared to 3,330 <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{tCO}_2\mathrm{e}\)</span> business travel
emissions for its approximate 4,000 staff members. The small amount of
travel emissions compared to emissions from commuting reflects to some
extent the status of CERN as a scientific centre, to which other members
of the community are expected to travel and where travel is easier to
avoid, also because the experiments are located at CERN.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Whilst ETHZ, FNAL and CERN face different boundary conditions, all
three of them, and HECAP+ institutions in general, should aim to reduce
emissions from commuting, even if these contribute to their overall
budget to a different degree.</p>
<p>This reduction requires an interplay of institutional and individual
actions: while institutions cannot force employees to choose more
environmentally sustainable commuting habits, they can incentivise them
through various measures, from the availability of bicycle-friendly
infrastructure, such as showers and secured/covered parking, to
financial incentives for greener transportation. They can also allow
employees to avoid long commutes by formalising telecommuting options,
which have become more normalised since the start of the COVID-19
pandemic, and use their standing to push local authorities towards
better public transit/cycling/carpool infrastructure. Individuals and
groups can, on the other hand, push for these actions at the
institutional level. Table <a href="#tab:subCommute"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:subCommute">1</a> collects
some means by which ETHZ, FNAL and other academic and HECAP+ institutes
promote ‘green’ transport. An estimate of the emissions per distance of
different forms of transport in France is presented in Figure <a

<h2 data-number="5.2" id="business-travel"><span
class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Business Travel</h2>
<p>A global scientific endeavour such as HECAP+ will mandate some amount
of long-distance travel, e.g., to experimental sites, or to build close
working relationships. However, the current academic culture, which
rewards hyper-mobility, is neither environmentally sustainable, nor
equitable to all scientists. Visa rules and prohibitive long-haul travel
costs can make participation in conferences extremely challenging,
especially for researchers from the Global South. Moreover, the freedom
to travel can be heavily restricted for people with disabilities, health
impairments or caring responsibilities. For example, the burden of
childcare is still unequally distributed, and this burden falls
predominately on female shoulders <span class="citation"
data-cites="McCarthy">[158]</span>.</p>
<p>Emissions from commercial aviation is a long-recognised problem,
contributing 2.5% of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span> emissions and 3.5% of
‘effective radiative forcing’ (a closer measure of aviation’s impact on
warming as explained in footnote <a href="#radiative_forcing_foot"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="radiative_forcing_foot">21</a>) <span class="citation"
data-cites="Rit20">[159]</span> in 2018. Note that the majority of these
emissions derive from the one-tenth of the world’s population that can
afford air travel. Almost all HECAP+ scientists belong to the 4% of the
population taking international flights, and many fall within the 1%
classified as the most frequent flyers <span class="citation"
data-cites="GOSSLING2020102194">[160]</span>. These statistics highlight
the inequalities inherent in travel emissions.</p>
<p>More troubling is that global aviation statistics belie the
significance of business travel emissions for many HECAP+ researchers,
which are comparable to, and in some cases even dwarf, their direct and
indirect emissions (see Figure <a href="#fig:Intro-ComparativeEmissions"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:Intro-ComparativeEmissions">4</a>). This is clearly
in tension with the push to net-zero emissions, particularly given that
we do not expect the aviation sector to decarbonise at the same rate as
the rest of the transport sector <span class="citation"
data-cites="Gota2019 Science18">[161], [162]</span>.</p>
<p>Emissions related to conference travel have been studied in detail
and dominate conference-related emissions <span class="citation"
data-cites="Spinellis nature_better_confs">[163], [164]</span>,
contributing annual emissions 30% larger than the total annual
transportation emissions for Geneva (720 kilotonnes <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span> <span class="citation"
data-cites="Geneve">[165]</span>). However, the <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span> emissions for a single
conference trip amount to about 7% of an average individual’s total
<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span> emissions <span
class="citation" data-cites="Spinellis">[163]</span>. This might be even
worse for HECAP+ researchers, for whom frequent trips to experimental
sites and meeting venues to undertake international collaborations are
common. See also emissions estimates for business travel of members of
the LHCb experiment at CERN in Case Study <a href="#case:LHCb"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="case:LHCb">[case:LHCb]</a>.</p>
<p>Discussions about reducing business travel are highly charged, as
active engagement with other members of the scientific community is
integral to scientific practice. Any changes that we make to
HECAP+ travel culture have to be considered in the context of other
aspects of our working practices, such as hiring decisions, where any
curbs on travel may, e.g., disproportionately impact early-career
researchers. At the same time, the reprioritisation of business travel
and a move toward a greater share of virtual/hybrid formats can have a
positive impact both on the climate and on inclusivity.</p>
<p>For necessary travel, sustainable alternatives to air travel should
be prioritised where possible, keeping in mind that the increased travel
time and costs of sustainable travel as compared with air travel could
make this choice difficult for researchers with caregiving
responsibilities, or limited travel budgets. In Case Study <a
href="#case:traveltoCERN" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="case:traveltoCERN">[case:traveltoCERN]</a>, we compare
emissions, travel time and cost of different modes of travel to CERN,
from various starting points within Europe, for CMS Week in January
2022. HECAP+ institutions and funding bodies are beginning to implement
more sustainable travel policies, including travel top-ups for green
travel; we highlight two examples in Best Practice <a href="#bp:Erasmus"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="bp:Erasmus">[bp:Erasmus]</a>
and Best Practice <a href="#bp:DESY_travel" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="bp:DESY_travel">[bp:DESY_travel]</a>.</p>
<p>If the community is to rethink this travel culture and move toward
more hybrid/virtual modes of engagement, we must recognise that these
require additional planning to maximise engagement, which amounts to
much more than streaming the in-person event format (see Case Study <a
href="#cs:CfH" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="cs:CfH">[cs:CfH]</a>). It is also important to
appreciate that virtual participation requires an internet-ready device
and stable connection, and devices with which to connect, which may not
be universally available in lower-income countries. A possible remedy
for this might be the concept of hub conferences, where the conference
has several locations spread globally (see, e.g., Ref. <span
class="citation" data-cites="Parncutt">[166]</span>). In Case Study <a
href="#case:ICHEP" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="case:ICHEP">[case:ICHEP]</a>, we study travel emissions
and participation in the context of the last 5 instances of the
International Conference for High Energy Physics (ICHEP) conference, and
assess the reduction in emissions from optimising the conference
location, moving to a hub model, or hybrid/virtual forms of
attendance.</p>

significantly smaller for rail travel as compared with travel by car or
air, as expected, this must be weighed against the increased travel
time, and in many cases, cost of rail travel. Note that the air travel
times are underestimated as they do not include travel to the airports,
which are usually distant from the city centres, or the usual buffer
time required for check-in and security formalities. For itineraries
that include sleeper trains, the additional cost of the train could
offset a night’s hotel accommodation at origin or destination.</p>

<p><span><strong>Case Study : Comparative study of travel emissions for
ICHEP conferences (2012–2020)<span id="case:ICHEP"

Based on the study of the annual meetings of the American Geophysical
Union (AGU) in Ref. <span class="citation"
data-cites="RefAGU">[147]</span>, and the methodology and software tools
employed therein, we undertake a survey of the past five editions of the
ICHEP with the aim of assessing the <span data-acronym-label="ghg"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">ghg</span> emissions of conference
travel to ICHEP, as well as the (geographical) diversity of
participants.</p>
<p>The International Conference for High Energy Physics (ICHEP) is a
biannual conference with a large and steadily growing participation, of
order 1,000 researchers, and a location that alternates mainly between
Europe, America and Asia. We study the 5 most recent instances, with
locations in Melbourne, Australia (2012); Valencia, Spain (2014);
Chicago, United States (2016); Seoul, Korea (2018); and Prague, Czech
Republic (2020, fully virtual).<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref"

<h4 data-number="5.2.0.1" id="methodology"><span
class="header-section-number">5.2.0.1</span> Methodology</h4>
<p>Participant details were taken from the Indico conference system
registration pages <span class="citation"
data-cites="indico">[169]</span>. The departure location for each
participant was assumed to be the city of their affiliation, save for
cases where it was clear that the participant was based in Geneva, as is
often the case for members of <span data-acronym-label="lhc"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">lhc</span> collaborations. Direct
travel to and from the conference was assumed. Distances were calculated
as the great-circle distance using coordinates obtained with Nominatim
from the OpenStreet Map data base. Rail, car or bus travel was assumed
for all journeys with distances of less than 400 km, with air travel
assumed for longer distances. ‘Short-haul’ was defined as travel
distances of less than 1,500 km; distances up to 8,000 km are
‘long-haul’; and longer distance still were classified as ‘super
long-haul’.<br />

<figcaption>Total number of participants of recent ICHEP conferences and
the GHG emissions per participant. The corresponding numbers for the
American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting <span class="citation"

</figure>
<p>Table <a href="#tab:icheppart" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="tab:icheppart">14</a> shows the average GHG emissions
per participant for the ICHEP editions alongside those for the 2019 AGU
Fall Meeting for reference. With the exception of the 2012 Melbourne
edition of ICHEP, the per-capita emissions were significantly lower for
ICHEP, which is a “travelling” conference, as compared with the
stationary AGU Meeting, which always takes place in San Francisco. This
indicates that moving a conference series between continents naturally
reduces the travel-related emissions as participants tend to wait for
the conference to be held near them to make the trip. Comparing the
geographical distribution of home institutes for each conference
reinforces this conclusion. Note that ICHEP Melbourne (2012) was the
first and only ICHEP conference taking place in Oceania.</p>
<p>The emissions for two typical ICHEP conferences, one in Europe
(Valencia) and one in Asia (Seoul) are displayed as a function of travel
distance in Figure <a href="#fig:EmmPerDistance"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:EmmPerDistance">15</a>. A
large fraction of attendees at the Seoul conference had to fly super
long-haul, giving rise to the majority of the emissions. Emissions for
the remaining half of the attendees was nearly negligible. This was not
the case for Valencia, where as many attendees travelled short haul or
less. It is also clear that the bulk of the emissions is due to
long-haul or super long-haul air travel.</p>

</figure>
<p>Reference <span class="citation" data-cites="RefAGU">[147]</span>
investigated possible optimisations of the conference location for the
given participant distribution in order to reduce emissions.<a
href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> Note that this is a slightly
artificial construction because of the basin of attraction phenomenon
discussed above, where participant distribution is self-selecting, based
on the conference location. Unlike the AGU example, where moving the
conference location to the middle of the country, rather than on a
coast, significantly decreased the travel-related emissions, we found
that the ICHEP locations were already pre-optimised, and further
optimisation yielded at most a 10.2% reduction of GHG emissions. (The
real outlier again was Melbourne, where the majority of participants had
to fly super long-haul, and for which a 70.7% reduction would be
achievable given the same participants by changing the location). If the
location was optimised using participants from all 5 ICHEPs, the optimal
location would be close to Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Further emissions reductions are only possible with a hub-based
conference, and mandatory virtual participation above a certain distance
from the hubs. Reference <span class="citation"
data-cites="RefAGU">[147]</span> trialled hubs in Chicago, Seoul and
Paris, with virtual attendance for all participants with origins greater
than 2,000 km from the hubs. Having found that Chicago, Seoul and Paris
were not far from the optimal locations for the respective ICHEP
conferences, we did the same, for the total ICHEP participation over the
5 conferences. Simply using a 3-hub model can reduce the carbon
footprint of the conference to around 15–35% of a traditional one.
Adding compulsory virtual participation for more distant participants
reduces the carbon footprint further by 5–15% of a traditional
conference with 10–25% of the participants attending virtually. As a
test case, and without any prior optimization, we chose Rio de Janeiro,
Johannesburg, and Kolkata as alternative hubs. This, however, increased
virtual participation to 95%¸ mainly due to the strong European
participation in <span data-acronym-label="hep"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">hep</span> and the remoteness of
Johannesburg from Western Europe. Switching Paris for Johannesburg
reduced the footprint to about 10% of the nominal one, with 40% of
participants attending virtually. While the virtual fraction is still
relatively high, it might be acceptable in a bid to include more remote
HEP communities (like Melbourne), while keeping the emissions low.</p>
<p>Finally, one might expect a fully virtual conference to be more
inclusive than in-person ones, especially for underserved participants,
such as those with care-giving responsibilities, limited travel funding,
or visa problems. We studied this by classifying participants by the
human development index (HDI) <span class="citation"
data-cites="hdiref">[170]</span> of their country of affiliation, and
dividing them into four categories (low, medium, high and very high
HDI).<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> The share of participants in these
categories for each of the ICHEP conferences is shown in Figure <a
href="#fig:DevelopmentIndex" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:DevelopmentIndex">16</a>. Indeed, in addition to
enjoying the largest number of participants (by a factor of 2), the
virtual ICHEP in Prague had the largest proportion of participants from
countries with high or medium human development index, although it was
not clear how much of this increase was due to its virtual nature, as
opposed to a steady increase in physics participation from high and
medium-HDI countries. There was virtually no participation from low HDI
countries in any of the ICHEP conferences studied.</p>

The EU mobility and training programme Erasmus+ has implemented funding
top-ups for environmentally sustainable travel, which is more costly
than point-to-point air travel in many instances, in particular between
hubs for low-cost airlines. See Table <a
href="#tab:ErasmusGreenSupplement" data-reference-type="ref"

for exact supplements for participants who receive travel funding, as
excerpted from the 2022 programme guide <span class="citation"

can be more time-consuming. The programme allows for this by providing
travel support for an additional 4 days of travel.<br />

data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">desy</span> have been based on the
goal of preserving the excellence of science and career opportunities
while reacting to the necessity to save <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span> and other emissions. With
its directive for business trips adopted in 2021, DESY relies on the
climate policy principle: Avoid — Reduce — Compensate.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid:</strong> The number of business trips will be reduced
by 30% compared to the situation before the start of the COVID-19
pandemic. This means that all travel planning is reviewed to identify
whether the trip is needed to achieve the intended purpose, whether a
virtual meeting could be just as beneficial, whether rotational changes
between presence and digital are possible, and whether and how
appointments can be bundled. In addition to <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span> savings and travel time, it
should also be considered how much of the time spent traveling and for
travel planning can actually be used as working time, and what costs are
incurred or saved. Ultimately, digital meetings also contribute to a
better flexibility between personal and work life. They also reduce
travel-related risks.</p>
<p><strong>Reduce:</strong> For some time now, it has already been
possible to use the train instead of the plane, even if the costs were
higher. With the new directive, the use of the train is now mandatory if
the destination can be reached within six hours total travel time. It
should also be noted that the usable working time during the trip for
rail travel is given as at least 50% of the travel time (depending on
the transfer frequency) and for flying it is assumed to be about 25% of
the travel time.</p>
<p><strong>Compensate:</strong> Until recently, compensation was not
possible under the Federal Travel Expenses Act. However, since September
2020, there is a new regulation on the reimbursement policy for carbon
offsets from the German ministry of science, whereby also grant
recipients like DESY are allowed to offset their <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span> emissions for business
trips. Starting in 2021, DESY will compensate the consequences of
unavoidable air travel. There are established systems through which the
climate-damaging effects of travel can be offset. The money goes to
climate protection projects, including energy efficiency, biogas or
biomass, solar energy, and environmental education. The selection of the
compensation projects can be steered by DESY.</p>

<p><span><strong>Case Study : Cosmology from Home<span id="cs:CfH"
label="cs:CfH"></span><br />
<span>This case study is, in part, adapted from the Cosmology from Home
website <span class="citation"
data-cites="CfHwebsite">[173]</span>.</span></strong></span><br />
Cosmology from Home (CFH) <span class="citation"
data-cites="CfHwebsite">[173]</span> is an “online by design” conference
series that has been run on a yearly basis since 2020. It exploits the
advantages of digital communication to accomplish things that have no
analogue in traditional conference formats, while staying true to the
dynamic and social nature of traditional conferences.</p>
<p>CfH is spread over two weeks, with two days per week dedicated to
plenary and parallel talks. Talks are pre-recorded and shared with the
conference participants ahead of the start of the conference. Other than
a strict time limit, CfH places few constraints on the format of the
talks. Participants are expected to watch the talks before the scheduled
online discussion events. The scheduled discussions last a maximum of
three hours per day to mitigate online fatigue, but multiple sessions
can be scheduled to accommodate different time zones.</p>
<p>Other days are reserved for themed discussions, which are proposed by
the participants. Topics have included content related directly to
cosmology, to scientific research more generally (i.e., technical or
computational aspects), and social aspects, such as inclusivity and
outreach in science.</p>
<p>The live discussions are hosted in virtual conference venue spaces to
create a social atmosphere in which participants can wander around and
join conversations. Suitable conference spaces are, e.g., Sococo <span
class="citation" data-cites="Sococo">[174]</span>, Welo <span
class="citation" data-cites="Welo">[175]</span> and Gather <span
class="citation" data-cites="Gather">[176]</span>. In case the number of
participants is such that the conference spaces are too small to host
everyone at once, break-out rooms of a suitable video-conferencing
platform can be used. In the specific case of CfH so far, this has been
Zoom <span class="citation" data-cites="Zoom">[177]</span>.</p>
<p>CfH is coordinated asynchronously through an online message board,
and a large part of the conference is dedicated to asynchronous
text-based discussions. These discussions can start before the official
opening of the conference and continue long after the conference has
finished. In previous years, CfH used Slack <span class="citation"
data-cites="Slack">[178]</span>. (Alternatives include MatterMost <span
class="citation" data-cites="MatterMost">[179]</span>, Zulip <span
class="citation" data-cites="Zulip">[180]</span>, Microsoft Teams <span
class="citation" data-cites="Teams">[181]</span> or Discord <span
class="citation" data-cites="Discord">[182]</span>.) Discussion channels
are grouped according to the scheduled live-talk discussion sessions
(see below). Participants can discuss points in dedicated threads in
these channels. Once a given discussion has grown sufficiently and has
branched out into different sub-discussions, it can be given its own
dedicated channel.</p>
<p>In addition to scheduled talk discussions, CfH implements scheduled
themed discussions. These are moderated, workshop-style discussions on
cosmological themes that are of interest to the conference participants.
The topics are suggested, voted on and chosen via the Slack workspace.
People can connect to the session via the conference space, but the main
session is hosted in Zoom break-out rooms.</p>
<p>The final live discussion format featured by CfH is composed of
spontaneous and unscheduled<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> “informal” live
discussions. The time allocated to the scheduled live discussions is
limited. The informal, breakaway sessions allow the participants to
engage in more detailed explorations of the topics brought up by the
live and asynchronous discussions.</p>
<p>The final live component of CfH consists of social events and
interaction formats, such as social games and casual get-togethers,
which complement the scientific discussion sessions on all days of the
conference. These activities aim to reproduce (at least partially) the
evening interactions of in-person conference social events.</p>
<p>One of the main advantages of the CfH format is that, compared to an
in-person conference, a much longer time can be spent debating the talks
of the participants. This allows for a much greater dissemination and
understanding of the research that is presented. Additionally, it
removes the need for travel. This keeps the participation costs low and
offers the potential for the conference to be carbon neutral or carbon
negative (achieved, at present, through carbon offsetting of residual
emissions). The online format also makes the conference accessible to
researchers from all over the world, subject to the availability of a
suitable device and a stable internet connection by which to connect.
The geographical distribution of participants in the previous three CfH
conferences are shown in Figure <a href="#fig:CfH1"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:CfH1">17</a>.</p>
<figure id="fig:CfH1">

<figcaption>Figure 16: Geographical distribution of Cosmology from Home
participants for each of the installments by year.<span id="fig:CfH1"
label="fig:CfH1"></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Additionally, participants can watch the talks according to their own
schedules and personal obligations. Participants are able to pause and
restart the talks, take time to digest them and to look up background
material. They are also able to prepare and raise points for discussion
in any of the conference environments. The asynchronous discussions can
be tailored exactly to the schedule of the conference participants.</p>
<p>In the first CfH (2020), participants needed time to adjust to the
format. This was to be expected, and the organisers actively encouraged
participants to partake of the various aspects of the conference and
actively modelled the expected social norms. The activity and enthusiasm
of participation increased year on year. Speakers created innovative and
accessible talk records, and participants regularly referred to these in
the live and text-based discussions. Participants organised watch
parties and impromptu discussions, made use of the various breakout
rooms, and gathered in the virtual environments. The themed discussions
proved to be particularly popular, and parallel sessions were often
necessary to accommodate the high number of topic suggestions.</p>
<p>All participant feedback has been constructive and positive, and CfH
has been well attended. The number of CfH participants were 255, 427 and
275 in 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively <span class="citation"
data-cites="CfHwebsite">[173]</span>. The format is easily tailored to
various topics: a conference featuring this format in HEP is expected to
be run in late 2023.</p>

<p><span data-acronym-label="hecap"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">hecap</span> research areas rely on
big science infrastructure. These particle accelerators, large-scale
collider experiments, observatories and associated buildings
infrastructure have a lifetime environmental impact from cradle to
grave. This is recognised in Section 8, “Sustainability considerations”,
in the Accelerator R&amp;D Roadmap of the European Strategy for Particle
Physics <span class="citation"
data-cites="EuropStrategyPP">[183]</span>. It divides the topic into
three aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Energy efficient technologies,</p></li>
<li><p>Energy efficient accelerator concepts, and</p></li>
<li><p>General sustainability aspects.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The first two focus on the biggest impact of accelerators: the energy
consumption during their operation. One aspect focuses on the current
technology and its energy efficiency, the other on the development of
new accelerator concepts with smaller energy requirements. These topics
are discussed in depth in other sections of the Strategy. The third
aspect is more broadly defined and considers sustainability beyond
energy <span class="citation"
data-cites="EuropStrategyPP">[183]</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A carbon footprint analysis in the design phase of a new facility
can help to optimise energy consumption for construction and operation.
For cooling purposes accelerator facilities typically have significant
water consumption. Cooling systems can be optimised to minimise the
impact on the environment. For the construction of a facility
environment-friendly materials should be identified and used preferably.
The mining of certain materials, in particular rare earths, takes place
in some countries under precarious conditions. It is desirable to
introduce and comply with certification of the sources of such materials
for industrial applications, including the construction of accelerators.
A thoughtful life cycle management of components will minimise
waste.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the case of astronomy research, Ref. <span class="citation"
data-cites="Kn_dlseder_2022">[184]</span> argues that emissions due to
research infrastructure dominate the carbon footprint of an
astronomer.</p>
<p>A number of initiatives have already been formed to consider the
manifold technical challenges of improving the environmental
sustainability of research infrastructure and associated technologies.
Three examples are listed below, (for others see Section <a

therein):</p>

sustainability. The current participating institutes are <span

in Germany, the European Spallation Source (ESS) in Sweden, the GSI in
Germany, the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) in Switzerland, and the
Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) in the United
Kingdom.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Environmental sustainability is also being considered by individual
experiments, and Case Study <a href="#case:LHCb"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="case:LHCb">[case:LHCb]</a>
provides a summary of efforts by the LHCb experimental collaboration to
assess and mitigate the environmental impact of both the experiment and
work practices, more generally.</p>
<p>In this section, we consider the following aspects of environmental
sustainability in research infrastructure: life cycle assessment (LCA),
(carbon) accounting, and technological developments, particularly in the
context of accelerator technologies and detector gases. While the
discussions of technological developments provide concrete examples, the
primary focus of this section is the need for critical life cycle
analysis for all research infrastructure projects to assess and limit
their environmental impacts. The impacts of mining and processing of
materials is also considered in Section <a href="#subsec:Resources"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="subsec:Resources">7.1</a>,
wherein complementary aspects of the LCA are also discussed.</p>

<p>There is currently limited availability of data on estimated
emissions and resources consumption for basic research infrastructure,
and, where it is available, its presentation is not standardised. This
makes overall assessments of sustainability and comparisons of
individual technologies challenging. Implementation of effective life
cycle assessment across the HECAP+community could provide the impetus
for standardised reporting that will provide the data needed for ongoing

<p>The environmental sustainability of future facilities will become an
increasingly important and heavily scrutinised factor in the decision
making process about which, if any, facility should be built. The life
cycle assessment for such facilities is extremely complex, and must
cover not only the accelerator and the detectors, but also the civil
engineering, such as tunnels and caverns, buildings infrastructure, and
computing needs. The impact of construction, then deconstruction (except
for the tunnel) and disposal (including activated materials, which may
constitute a radiation hazard) after a few years is not negligible.</p>
<p>The evaluation of the <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span> footprint due to the
electricity consumption of a future collider is particularly
challenging, since any estimate relies heavily on assumptions about
future electricity mix. A conservative estimate might be given based on
the current <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span> footprint
for electrical energy, under the assumption that the grid will be
decarbonised — indeed it has to be to meet the world’s climate goals —
by the time any future collider is commissioned. However, there is the
opportunity to adapt to potential sources of renewable energy (see also
Section <a href="#sec:Energy" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:Energy">3</a>) in the design stages, and to go
beyond arguments of “electrical effectiveness” based on scientific
benchmarks, such as kWh/Higgs or kWh/luminosity compared to the required
connected power.</p>

Standardised accounting of the carbon footprint of French research
institutions: labos1point5 <span id="BP:l1p5"
label="BP:l1p5"></span>]<span>Carbon footprint accounting with the
Labos1point5 tool</span> <em>Laboratoires de recherche</em>, loosely
translated as research labs, are the entities around which most of
French research is organised. They enjoy a relevant degree of autonomy,
including aspects such as scientific goals and experimental designs.
Access to research facilities, as well as a fraction of the annual
budget, is also managed at the lab scale. Hence, this makes it a
relevant scale to tackle the question of the carbon footprint of
academic research.</p>
<p>This has motivated the creation of the <em>labos1point5</em> working
group (<em>Groupement De Recherche</em>, GDR),<a href="#fn28"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>
gathering an interdisciplinary team of engineers and researchers from
various research fields in France. One of the main outputs of this
collaboration is the <em>GES 1point5</em>,<a href="#fn29"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> a
standardised online tool for the accounting of the carbon footprint of
French research labs. What follows is a brief summary of the latter. We
refer to Ref. <span class="citation" data-cites="labos1p5">[155]</span>
for a publication describing it. Further information can be found on the
website of the labos1point5 collaboration <span class="citation"
data-cites="labos1p5web">[12]</span>. The tool itself is available at
<span class="citation" data-cites="ges1p5">[196]</span>, while the open
source code is hosted at <span class="citation"
data-cites="ges1p5git">[197]</span>. The GDR labos1point5 is also active
in helping labs in their transition to a lower footprint, in developing
new ways of teaching climate and ecological aspects to students, as well
as of communicating to the general public. Finally, there are teams
dedicated to the reflection on the role of science in the climate
crisis, and on fostering collaboration between arts and science in this
context.</p>
<p>As explained in Ref. <span class="citation"
data-cites="labos1p5">[155]</span>, one of the main motivations for the
creation of the GES 1point5 tool was the difficulty in aggregating or
comparing the results of the many existing studies in the literature on
the carbon footprint of academic research. This difficulty was caused by
the sensitivity of the footprint to the applied methodology, which made
comparisons extremely challenging, since discrepancies in results could
not be disentangled from methodological differences. The creation of the
GES 1point5 was then intended to provide a tool specifically designed to
estimate the carbon footprint of research with a transparent and
accessible methodology and a database of carbon footprints assessed with
the same methodology to enable a robust comparison of research carbon
footprints across institutions, contexts or disciplines.</p>
<p>More specifically, GES 1point5 allows research labs to estimate their
yearly emissions — as of February 15, 2023, 628 laboratories have
compiled 1,140 yearly carbon footprint determinations <span
class="citation" data-cites="labos1p5web">[12]</span>. Currently, GES
1point5 can estimate <span data-acronym-label="ghg"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">ghg</span> emissions due to the
energy consumption and refrigerant gases of the laboratories’ buildings,
those attributed to the purchase of their digital devices, and to
computing, commuting and professional travel, as well as the associated
uncertainties. A module estimating emissions from consumables purchases
has recently been added. In all cases, the estimation is based upon its
established standardised methodology, and the database of emission
factors, and turns out to be relatively straightforward for the end
user.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> To give an example, commuting
emissions are estimated by gathering data through an anonymised survey
sent to staff members, which can be answered in less than five minutes.
For each specified commute (up to two different ones per week can be
entered), GES 1point5 multiplies the distance traveled via each means of
transportation by the specific emission factor from its database. These
are collected in Figure <a href="#fig:emiMobility"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:emiMobility">13</a> in
Section <a href="#sec:Travel" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:Travel">5</a>. The underlying routines are available

<p>Once the emissions have been estimated, GES 1point5 presents the
results through its graphical interface, highlighting the main drivers
of the carbon footprint. Finally, emissions reduction actions that may
be undertaken after the evaluation of the footprint can be evaluated in
the subsequent years, thanks to the reliance on a standardised protocol.
The latter also allows the aforementioned aggregation and comparison of
GES 1point5-based carbon footprints.</p>
<p>As stated in Ref. <span class="citation"
data-cites="labos1p5">[155]</span>, while some aspects of GES 1point5
are specific to the context of French research, the tool may be reused
in research centers elsewhere, provided the necessary adjustments —
e.g., carbon intensity of the grid — are made. French- and an
English-language versions of GES 1point5 are built into the current
version to ease deployment in any country. Contacts with several
institutions outside France have been established.</p>

The operation of particle accelerator facilities is inherently
resource-intensive, and thus poses a challenge to sustainability. In
line with acknowledging our responsibility for sustainable usage of
energy resources, the development, establishment, and demonstration of a
scalable multi-turn Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) with efficient energy
recycling was implemented at the S-DALINAC accelerator at TU Darmstadt,
Germany <span class="citation" data-cites="Arnold:2020snn">[201]</span>.
An efficient energy-recycling in multi-turn operation with a saving of
up to 87% of the beam power-consumption in the main LINAC has been
recently demonstrated. This result, together with further developments
on multi-turn ERLs is a promising basis for future high-power beams that
truly support sustainability aspects. These examples include ER@CEBAF in
the USA <span class="citation" data-cites="Meot:2018yoo">[202]</span>;

<span><span>Edited contribution from Nikola

A promising technology, which would reduce both the material and energy
cost of accelerating particles, and hence improve its environmental
sustainability, is wakefield acceleration <span class="citation"
data-cites="wakefield1">[209]</span>. These use laser pulses (in the
case of laser wakefield accelerators) or particle beam bunches (for
plasma wakefield accelerators, PWFAs) as the driver to accelerate plasma
electrons, creating ion cavities. This creates an electric field that
pulls electrons back to their original positions, which they overshoot,
creating waves in the plasma, known as the wakefield. These plasma waves
can accelerate electrons by transferring energy from the drive beam to
electrons by putting electrons just behind the drive beam. Wakefield
technology routinely gives acceleration gains of <span
class="math inline">\(10\)</span>–<span
class="math inline">\(100\)</span> GeV/m <span class="citation"
data-cites="wakefield1">[209]</span>, thus resulting in a significant
reduction of the resources required (materials, energy) to build
particle accelerators. For example, accelerating electrons to 1 TeV of
energy using PWFA would require, e.g., only a 21 km-long particle
accelerator, while <span data-acronym-label="clic"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">clic</span> technology needs 52
km <span class="citation" data-cites="wakefield2">[210]</span>.
Furthermore, there are indications that PWFA is more power efficient at
high energies than conventional accelerator technology <span

<h3 data-number="6.2.1" id="gases"><span
class="header-section-number">6.2.1</span> Gases</h3>
<p>Significant quantities of GHGs are used for particle detection
technologies and cooling systems across HECAP+. As such, they are used
as a resource, but can escape the detector volume into the atmosphere
and turn into potentially dangerous waste gases. Table <a
href="#tab:GasImpact" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="tab:GasImpact">2</a> lists a number of GHGs, their
chemical formulae, atmospheric lifetimes and global warming potentials
(<span data-acronym-label="gwp"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">gwp</span>). All of these gases are
used either for cooling purpose or as active ingredients in gaseous
detector systems, where they are often added to noble gases to improve
detector properties, such as drift charge velocities or diffusion
coefficients <span class="citation"
data-cites="Sauli:2014cyf">[211]</span>.</p>
<p>Whilst gases are used in a variety of detectors, such as time
projection chambers, ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors or multi-wire
proportional chambers, the main offenders in ecological terms are the
detectors used in the muon systems of the LHC experiments, specifically
resistive plate chambers (RPCs). This is due to their large areas of
around 7,000 m<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span> in total for both
the CMS and ATLAS muon systems, and the gas mixtures used to cope with
the large event rates at the LHC, which often feature HFC-134a as a main
component.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure <a href="#fig:Intro-ComparativeEmissions"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:Intro-ComparativeEmissions">4</a>, Scope 1 direct
emissions made up about 25% of CERN’s carbon footprint in 2019. During
the LHC Run 2 in 2018, it was about a factor of two larger. 92% of these
Scope 1 emissions are related to the activities of the large LHC
experiments <span class="citation"
data-cites="Environment:2737239 envrep2020">[1], [212]</span>. CERN and
the LHC experiments are actively working on reducing this impact by
continuously repairing gas leaks that are one of the main reasons for
the large amount of waste gas. In addition, CERN has tested an HFC-134a
recuperation plant showing an efficiency of close to 85%, which is to be
installed in the detectors to reduce the environmental impact <span
class="citation" data-cites="envrep2020">[212]</span>, and is actively
researching alternative gas mixtures <span class="citation"
data-cites="Mandelli:2022qjc">[213]</span>. Future detector projects

<p>The gases responsible for about 80% of CERN’s Scope 1 direct annual
GHG emissions are perfluorocarbons (PFC), hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) and
sulphur hexafluoride (SF<span class="math inline">\(_6\)</span>) in
particle detection, and HFCs and PFCs for detector cooling. To put the
emissions into context, CERN’s PFC emissions are roughly of the same
size as the Swiss emissions <span class="citation"
data-cites="PFCdata">[219]</span> and only reduce by about 30% when
there is no LHC run. For 2017 and 2018 (during LHC data taking), CERN’s
SF<span class="math inline">\(_6\)</span> emissions are about 5% of
Switzerland’s, and of the same size as those of Luxembourg or
Latvia <span class="citation" data-cites="SF6data">[220]</span>. The HFC
emissions are 6% of the Swiss emissions, about twice the size of
Luxembourg’s and a bit less than half of Latvia’s emissions, again
looking at 2017–2018 data <span class="citation"
data-cites="HFCdata">[221]</span>. During 2020–2021, when the LHC, and
more importantly its experiments, shutdown for upgrades and maintenance,
SF<span class="math inline">\(_6\)</span> emissions were down to about a
third, while HFC emissions were down to 25%. All of these so-called
F-gases have EU supply restrictions imposed on them since 2015 <span
class="citation" data-cites="EUFgasregulation">[218]</span>, effectively
phasing out their usage. A 2022 regulation proposal aims to extend EU
regulations, e.g., to reduce HFC usage down to 2.4% by 2048 compared to
2015 levels <span class="citation"
data-cites="EUFgasregulation_new">[222]</span>. An additional
significant factor in this proposal is the removal of certain sector
exemptions for HFC usage, such as research. All of this could
significantly impact the availability and cost of F-gases in the future
and therefore affect the HECAP+ community, which should be reflected in
the plans for ongoing and future experiments. Even independent of these
EU regulations, the HECAP+ community should work with highest priority
on abolishing problematic GHGs in existing and future detectors.
Ideally, this would consist of replacing them with non-GHGs, or gases
with low GWP, or gasless detector technology.</p>
<p>For cooling of the LHC-experiments, concrete plans are in place to
upgrade the future detectors (Phase-II Upgrades) to CO<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> cooling, reducing the total Scope-1
carbon footprint of the experiments during HL-LHC exploitation
significantly <span class="citation"
data-cites="Barroca:2021hal Zwalinski:2023ira">[223], [224]</span>.</p>
<p>Solutions to the problem of gas use for particle detection are less
straightforward. In some scenarios, low-GWP gases used as replacements
for industrial applications are not suitable for detector applications
and, as such, studies for alternative gases are currently ongoing. The
difficulty in finding replacement gases originates from having to
satisfy several factors: safety (non-flammable and low toxicity) and
environmental impact (minimising GWP), while maintaining their detector
performance (including preventing the ageing of the detectors, ensuring
good quenching<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> and being radiation-hard) <span
class="citation" data-cites="Bloom:2022gux">[27]</span>.</p>
<p>Current gas mixture alternatives for particle detection are centred
around tetrafluoropropene (chemical formula C<span
class="math inline">\(_3\)</span>H<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>F<span
class="math inline">\(_4\)</span> and industrially referred to as
HFO-1234ze/R-1234ze). The mixture has zero ozone-depletion potential and
a global warming potential below 1, over a span of 100 years.
Simulations of RPCs that operate with various gas mixtures, which
include R-1234ze, have shown encouraging results, although further
studies are still required <span class="citation"
data-cites="Fan:2022azj_ref3 Proto:2021taf_ref4">[225],
[226]</span>.</p>
<p>Long term, it is crucial to design future detector systems with gas
GWP in mind. Consequently, it is essential that current state-of-the-art
and future detectors are compatible with this and, if not, R&amp;D is
aimed at reducing the GHG emissions of such systems.</p>

In a world with increasing demand on limited resources and undergoing
climate change, the LHCb collaboration feels a responsibility to
consider energy consumption, sustainability and efficiency when
discussing our scientific proposals. To this end the Framework Technical
Design Report of the next-generation LHCb Upgrade II experiment <span
class="citation" data-cites="LHCbU2FTDR">[227]</span> has included a
dedicated chapter on these considerations analysing the current Upgrade
I system and indicating directions for future investigation. This
section reports some of the main elements.</p>
<p>The 2020 update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics <span
class="citation" data-cites="EuropeanStrategy2020">[228]</span> reports:
“The environmental impact of particle physics activities should continue
to be carefully studied and minimised. A detailed plan for the
minimisation of environmental impact and for the saving and re-use of
energy should be part of the approval process for any major project.
Alternatives to travel should be explored and encouraged.” As one of the
major experimental infrastructures operating at the <span
data-acronym-label="lhc" data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">lhc</span>,
our environmental protection strategy should be made in coordination
with <span data-acronym-label="cern"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">cern</span> guidelines, as described
in the first CERN environment report <span class="citation"
data-cites="envrep2020">[212]</span>.</p>
<p>CERN has a formal objective to reduce direct emissions (“Scope 1”) by
<span class="math inline">\(28\%\)</span> by the end of 2024. These are
dominated by the activities of the LHC experiments, and in particular by
the use of fluorinated gases for particle detection and detector cooling
purposes, as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:cern_co2"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:cern_co2">19</a>. These
emissions have to be carefully considered in the operation of the
Upgrade I detector and in the design of its future upgrade. Other
relevant aspects of the environmental impact of our project are the
power consumption of the experimental infrastructure (indirect
emissions, “Scope 2”), the impact of digital technologies, and travel of
the members of the collaboration. Figure <a href="#fig:lhcb_co2"

<h4 data-number="6.2.1.1" id="direct-emissions"><span
class="header-section-number">6.2.1.1</span> Direct emissions</h4>
<p>Direct emissions from LHCb are dominated by losses of gases with
sizeable global warming potential (GWP). The GWP is the heat absorbed by
a GHG in the atmosphere as a multiple of the same mass of CO<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>. It thus allows conversion into
CO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> equivalent emissions. As some
gases break down, they have time-dependent values, and we use the 100
year value <span class="citation" data-cites="AR5">[229]</span>. The
gases are utilised in LHCb in detector cooling systems and in the
detection systems. Improvements made in the cooling systems of LHCb mean
that emissions are now dominated by the detection system in Upgrade I.
All systems are closed, with emissions being the result of losses.</p>
<p>In the original LHCb detector of Run 1 and 2, the gas C<span
class="math inline">\(_6\)</span>F<span
class="math inline">\(_{14}\)</span> (GWP 7910) was used in cooling
plants. For upgrade I, “Novec 649" (GWP 1) is planned to be used, along
with increased use of low-impact CO<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> based cooling. For Upgrade II, lower
operating temperatures are foreseen, and the GWP of the cooling systems
will be considered.</p>
<p>In the detector systems, the Ring Imaging Cherenkov Systems (RICH1
and 2) and Muon systems of Upgrade I use GHGs. The RICH2 system
currently uses CF<span class="math inline">\(_4\)</span> (GWP 6630) and
RICH1 C<span class="math inline">\(_4\)</span>F<span
class="math inline">\(_{10}\)</span> (GWP 9200) radiators. R&amp;D will
be pursued for Upgrade II on alternative gases, RICH2 is looking at
CO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> use, where a test has already
been performed, and leakless systems. Significant effort has been made
to minimise leaks. In the original LHCb detector, GEM detectors (gas
electron multiplier detectors) were utilised in a part of the muon
system. The removal of these for Upgrade I reduces the detector system
emissions by 40%. Recirculating systems are used throughout. The study
of alternative gas mixture will be conducted to reduce the CF<span
class="math inline">\(_4\)</span> consumption in the proposed future
muon systems.</p>
<p>The CO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> equivalent emissions
expected in Run 3 are shown in Figure <a href="#fig:LHCbCO2e"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:LHCbCO2e">21</a>. These

<h4 data-number="6.2.1.2" id="sec:powerconsumption"><span
class="header-section-number">6.2.1.2</span> Power consumption</h4>
<p>CERN peak power demand, with the full accelerator chain running, is
about <span class="math inline">\(180\)</span> MW, which brings the
total annual energy consumption to <span
class="math inline">\(1.2\)</span> TWh. This very large energy demand is
partially mitigated by the fact that the electricity procurement is
mainly from France, whose production capacity is 87.9<span
class="math inline">\(\%\)</span> carbon-free (2017-figures). This keeps
the contribution from the electrical power to the total CERN emission
budget below 20<span class="math inline">\(\%\)</span>, as shown in
Figure <a href="#fig:cern_co2" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:cern_co2">19</a>.<a href="#fn32"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>
Nevertheless, guided by the Energy Management Panel, EMP, CERN is
spending a large effort to improve energy efficiency, with special focus
on the accelerator sector. As an example, in the transition to the <span
data-acronym-label="hl-lhc"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">hl-lhc</span>, with a tenfold
increase in luminosity, the Organization’s immediate priority is to
limit the increase in energy consumption to 5<span
class="math inline">\(\%\)</span> up to the end of 2024.</p>
<p>LHCb during a normal data taking period of Run 2 had a peak power
demand stably around 5.5 MW, of which 4.6 MW was from the experiment
dipole magnet, and the rest was from the detector electronics and the
online computing farm. The Run 3 expectation is for an increase of <span
class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span>1.5 MW due to the increased demand of
data processing power, which is to be compared to the five-fold increase
in luminosity. For Run 5 and beyond, the contribution of online
computing is expected to increase substantially, as a consequence of a
further order of magnitude increase in the data throughput.</p>
<p>For the power dissipated by the LHCb magnet, an important mitigation
has been implemented very recently by CERN with the installation of a
heat-recovery plant at the experimental site. This is intended to use
the hot water produced by the magnet and the machine cooling systems to
heat a new residential area in the town of Ferney-Voltaire next to the
LHCb site. Thanks to this project, up to 8,000 people’s homes will be
heated at a lower cost and with reduced CO<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> emissions, corresponding to <span
class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span>2.5% of the total CERN emission
budget per year.</p>
<h4 data-number="6.2.1.3" id="digital-technologies"><span
class="header-section-number">6.2.1.3</span> Digital technologies</h4>
<p>The power consumption of the online computing farm at LHCb has been
about 530 kW on average during Run 2 of the LHC. To cope with the
significantly increased computing needs after Upgrade I, a new data
centre has recently been installed at Point 8 and the power consumption
for computing is going to increase to 2,000 kW for the upcoming data
taking periods. The new computing data centre at Point 8 is located in a
surface building and for practical reasons could not be included in the
heat recovery project discussed in Sec. <a href="#sec:powerconsumption"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:powerconsumption">6.2.1.2</a> above. However, great
care has been put into the design to optimise its power efficiency, for
example by implementing a state-of-the-art indirect free air cooling
system with adiabatic assist <span class="citation"
data-cites="lbldcreport">[231]</span>. A <span data-acronym-label="pue"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">pue</span> of better than 1.08 has
been achieved for the new data centre at Point 8, a value that compares
favourably with other large computing centres <span class="citation"
data-cites="pue-data">[232]</span>.</p>
<p>While it does not seem feasible to further improve the PUE of the
data centre, energy savings could potentially be achieved by adjusting
the operating mode to the actual computing needs at a given point in
time. Significant improvements in energy efficiency can be achieved by
rewriting software so that it can efficiently exploit today’s highly
parallel computing architectures. LHCb has been doing this in
preparation for Run 3 data taking and the impact of these activities on
the energy efficiency of our software has been documented in <span
class="citation" data-cites="hlt1-energy-eff">[233]</span>. In total the
energy efficiency of HLT1 (High Level Trigger 1) software has been
improved by a factor <span class="math inline">\(4.8\times\)</span> on
<span data-acronym-label="cpu"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">cpu</span>s, with the improvements
coming in roughly equal parts from physics optimizations and the rewrite
of the underlying software framework. A further improvement in energy
efficiency can also be achieved by porting suitable algorithms from CPUs
to more efficient technologies such as <span data-acronym-label="gpu"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">gpu</span>s, field programmable gate
arrays (FPGAs) or even custom-made application specific integration
circuits (ASICs). LHCb has demonstrated this with the Allen
project <span class="citation" data-cites="Allen">[234]</span>, which
implemented HLT1 on GPUs, leading to an overall improvement in energy
efficiency of up to <span class="math inline">\(19\)</span> times
compared to the Run 2 architecture. These improvements require
significant effort and investment, above all in the training and
retention of scientists able to effectively program across a range of
modern computing architectures.</p>
<p>The energy efficiency of the underlying computer hardware has also
improved substantially over time. For example, the AMD 7502 <span
class="citation" data-cites="AMD7502">[235]</span> CPUs, which were
evaluated as candidates for LHCb’s Run 3 HLT, are <span
class="math inline">\(2.6\)</span> times more energy efficient than the
benchmark E5-2630 Xeon CPUs used by LHCb during Run 2. Within a given
computing architecture, energy savings can also be achieved by
purchasing more expensive, higher quality hardware. As an example from
the world of CPU, the more expensive AMD 7742 <span class="citation"
data-cites="AMD7742">[236]</span> provides twice the number of CPU cores
and threads as the cheaper AMD 7502 <span class="citation"
data-cites="AMD7502">[235]</span>, while its specified power consumption
is only 25% higher. The energy consumption and carbon footprint from
data transfer, data storage and offline computing are much harder to
assess than those for online computing, due to the distributed nature of
the computing model with data centres and users distributed over many
different countries. The GRAND collaboration has performed pioneering
work in this direction <span class="citation"
data-cites="Aujoux_2021">[189]</span>.</p>
<h4 data-number="6.2.1.4" id="mobility"><span
class="header-section-number">6.2.1.4</span> Mobility</h4>
<p>As an international collaboration operating in an international field
of research, travel is an intrinsic part of how LHCb operates. We have
estimated the environmental impact of travel in order to attend LHCb
collaboration meetings and international conferences. We have not taken
into account local commuter travel or travel related to on-site work at
LHCb, such as shifts, although the latter is probably significant.</p>
<p>The impact of travel per participant for a typical LHCb collaboration
week, pre-pandemic, corresponded to around 0.5 <span
data-acronym-label="tco2e"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">tco2e</span> with the average LHCb
week in 2019 leading to travel-emissions of <span
class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> 180<span
class="math inline">\(\,\mathrm{tCO_2e}\)</span>. The Speakers’ Bureau
database provides a complete record of all LHCb conference talks,
allowing us to estimate the environmental impact in terms of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{tCO_2e}\)</span> per year. LHCb weeks and
conference travel contribute a total of approximately <span
class="math inline">\(1,000\,\mathrm{tCO_2e}\)</span> per annum, a
similar carbon footprint to the Run 3 experiment’s projected electricity
use due to online computing and the magnet (French energy mix). LHCb
weeks contribute about three times as much to LHCb’s carbon footprint as
conference travel. The carbon footprint of virtual conference attendance
is calculated according to the life cycle and operating costs of
endpoint devices estimates in Ref. <span class="citation"
data-cites="VideoConCO2">[237]</span>, and is small.</p>
<p>LHCb, in common with other High Energy Physics collaborations, had
extensive experience with virtual meetings before COVID, and
videoconferencing technology has already helped to reduce travel-related
emissions over the past decade. However, the pandemic, as well as recent
improvements to the videoconferencing software infrastructure, have
shown us ways in which the organisation of virtual meetings can be
improved and made more inclusive. At the same time the pandemic has also
reminded us of the ongoing importance of in-person interaction, not
least to avoid fracturing the collaboration between those who can
regularly travel to CERN in eco-friendly ways and those who cannot. The
collaboration has only just started to navigate this tension but is
actively exploring ways to reduce its travel-related environmental
impact.</p>

<p>Half of the world’s <span data-acronym-label="ghg"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">ghg</span> emissions, and over 90% of
global water stress and biodiversity loss events, are due to the
extraction and processing of raw materials <span class="citation"
data-cites="EURaw">[238]</span>. Although most extracted materials are
slated for the energy or agriculture sectors, the small fraction
associated with consumption of goods and services is responsible for 18%
of EU emissions <span class="citation" data-cites="EURaw">[238]</span>.
Mitigating the climate impacts of the extraction, processing and trade
of raw materials is a priority for the resilience of the EU <span
class="citation" data-cites="EURaw">[238]</span>, and it should also be
a priority for the world climate agenda.</p>
<p>The generation of waste is a direct consequence of material
consumption, and is aggravated by constraints in production,
distribution, usage and repair, and disposal or recycling of
consumables. Waste has severe impacts on life on land and at sea, often
destabilizing local ecosystems. It also damages the global ecosystem by
contributing to climate change. Accumulations and inefficient disposal
of waste products can result in pollution of ground water and air, thus
directly affecting the health of individuals and communities at a large
cost to society in terms of disease burden and lives lost.</p>
<p>In an attempt to curb the footprint of waste generation, the concept
of a circular economy has been proposed <span class="citation"
data-cites="CircularEconomy">[239]</span>. Any such proposal must be
established in parallel with a will to reduce waste at source through
sustainable procurement, repair and reuse, and used only as a
transitional measure. Even a fully circular economy has some
dissipation, and signatures of this energy waste need to be
independently addressed and reduced <span class="citation"
data-cites="Forbes SocialEurope WRI">[240]–[242]</span>.</p>
<p>Procurement accounts for almost two-thirds of annual emissions at
<span data-acronym-label="cern"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">cern</span> <span class="citation"
data-cites="CERNTownHall">[243]</span>, with a GHG footprint of the same
order as its direct emissions in 2018, when the LHC was running <span
class="citation" data-cites="Environment:2737239">[1]</span>. Although
not yet fully included in reporting by other HECAP+ institutions, the
environmental cost of procurement is likely proportionately large
elsewhere. Maximising the sustainability of the use cycle of resources
should be a priority of the <span data-acronym-label="hecap"

<h2 data-number="7.1" id="subsec:Resources"><span
class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Resources</h2>
<p>HECAP+ research can be resource-intensive, particularly in the
building and maintenance of the often large experiments that drive
progress in our fields. These resources have an environmental impact
over their entire life cycle, due to extraction of the raw materials
used in their manufacture, their production and use, and their disposal
once they become unusable or obsolete. Of these, the raw materials
processing stage has been highlighted as having the greatest potential
for emissions reduction (see, e.g., Figure 2 of Ref. <span
class="citation" data-cites="EURaw">[238]</span>).</p>
<p>The extraction of raw materials has important and extensive
environmental costs <span class="citation"
data-cites="Dolega:2016">[244]</span>, mostly associated with the mining
industry. Acid mine drainage is the overriding problem and is a serious
threat to water resources. It results from water flow over ore creating
sulphuric acid and leaching heavy metals from surrounding rock, thus
contaminating groundwater and soil. Mining operations can also deplete
water resources, particularly in regions of limited water supply,
severely restricting the availability of water to local consumers. Fine
particles and dust produced during mining operations and dispersed by
winds affect air quality, and mining and its infrastructure leads to
loss of agricultural land and even entire ecosystems through
contamination or destruction of soil cover. Mining is the world’s
largest producer of waste, with copper, zinc, bauxite and nickel mining
generating the largest ratios of waste to mined metal. Disposal or
storage of tailings, the waste products remaining after the extraction
of valuable material from ore, is a major problem. These can be
radioactive, and are sometimes illegally disposed of directly into
rivers or seas. Even when stored ‘responsibly’ in tailings dams,
incorrect geological siting of these dams, in tectonically active zones
or regions of high rainfall, can lead to catastrophic loss of life and
usable land <span class="citation"
data-cites="SILVAROTTA2020102119">[245]</span>.</p>
<p>Environmental sustainability aside, mining has a poor safety and
human rights record <span class="citation"
data-cites="ResponsibleMiningIndex">[246]</span>, and is sometimes
subject to dubious financing <span class="citation"
data-cites="MiningandMoneyLaundering">[247]</span>. Mining of ‘conflict
minerals’, such as tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold, used in mobile
phones and other everyday products, are sometimes used to finance armed
conflict <span class="citation"
data-cites="EUConflictMinerals">[248]</span>.</p>
<p>Sustainability regulations, both externally imposed and voluntary,
are slowly being incorporated into the raw materials supply chains
(see,e.g., the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights <span
class="citation" data-cites="VoluntaryPrinciples">[249]</span>), albeit
slowly, and in an inconsistent and sometimes superficial manner <span
class="citation"
data-cites="ResponsibleMiningIndex ResponsibleMiningFoundation">[246],
[250]</span>. For examples of sustainability initiatives, in particular
in relation to raw materials supply chains, see Best Practice <a
href="#bp:SustainableRawMaterials" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="bp:SustainableRawMaterials">[bp:SustainableRawMaterials]</a>.</p>
<p>An analysis of components used inside a smartphone and their impacts
can be found in Ref. <span class="citation"
data-cites="fairphone">[251]</span>. Smartphone manufacturer Fairphone,
for instance, sustainably sourced 56% of 8 of the materials used in its
phones in 2020, and have a set a target of fair sourcing of 70% of 14
materials by 2023 <span class="citation"

<p>A ranked list of mined metals by overall environmental impact can be
found in Table <a href="#tab:MetalImpact" data-reference-type="ref"

taken from the EU Raw Materials Information System <span
class="citation" data-cites="EURMIS">[253]</span>, with source data from
Ref. <span class="citation" data-cites="UNEP2010">[254]</span>. Sourcing
recycled metal from scrap produces significantly lower emissions.
Secondary aluminium, for example, was reported by the European Aluminium
Association to emit 95% fewer GHGs than primary production <span
class="citation" data-cites="EURaw">[238]</span>. Other materials used
in HECAP+ experiments (e.g., cobalt for magnets, rare earths for
permanent magnets, niobium) are produced under very difficult
conditions, with a high environmental or societal cost <span

<h3 data-number="7.1.1" id="life-cycle-assessment"><span
class="header-section-number">7.1.1</span> Life cycle assessment</h3>
<p>Best practices in sustainable use and disposal of resources begins
with a life cycle assessment (LCA): a cradle-to-grave accounting of all
the environmental impacts of a resource. As an example the ISO 14040
 <span class="citation" data-cites="ISO14040">[259]</span> and ISO
14044 <span class="citation" data-cites="ISO14044">[260]</span>
standards provide a systematic procedure for the analysis. Depending on
the goal and scope of the analysis, the life cycle inventory comprises
the quantification of all input and output flows. This includes raw
materials, consumables, energy, products, waste, emissions, and
groundwater and soil contamination. There are online tools and auditing
agencies who provide help with the analysis, see, e.g., Ref. <span
class="citation" data-cites="ProBasSi">[194]</span>. For an LCA of a
silicon wafer used in particle detectors, see Best Practice <a

<p>Purchasing policy can have a major impact on the environmental costs
of procurement. The HECAP+ community should prioritise suppliers that
implement sustainable thinking, sourcing, and operation. This could
include voluntary provision of life cycle assessments for their products
(see above), or certification of, e.g., proof of origin. Sustainability
requirements on suppliers could also be incorporated into tenders and
purchasing regulations, allowing these considerations to be weighed in
tandem with cost in the tendering process. Since much of HECAP+ funding
is public, purchasing regulations, which are influenced by funding
agencies, an additional important stakeholder in this process, must be
reassessed. For examples of best practice in sustainable procurement,
see Best Practice <a href="#bp:SustainableRawMaterials"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="bp:SustainableRawMaterials">[bp:SustainableRawMaterials]</a>.
A strategic approach to sustainable purchasing has been outlined in ISO
20400 <span class="citation" data-cites="ISO20400">[261]</span>.</p>
<p>CERN is in the process of defining a new environmentally responsible
procurement policy, to be implemented in 2023 <span class="citation"

requiring sustainability certification from suppliers, with a focus on

<h2 data-number="7.2" id="subsec:Waste"><span
class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Waste</h2>
<p>Around 3% of global GHG emissions is due to solid waste disposal, the
organic component of which decomposes in wastewater and landfills,
producing methane and nitrous oxide <span class="citation"
data-cites="owidco2andothergreenhousegasemissions">[13]</span>. This is
despite a 60% decrease in the amount of waste landfilled in the EU in
the past two decades, due partly to an increased legislative focus on
alternative treatment methods, such as recycling and composting, as well
as more widespread landfill gas recovery <span class="citation"
data-cites="Eurostat">[262]</span>.</p>
<p>The fastest-growing portion of EU waste output is E-waste <span
class="citation" data-cites="EUNews">[263]</span>: powered products with
electrical components that are discarded into the waste stream. In
addition to releasing hazardous chemicals into the environment,
improperly treated E-waste contributes to global warming through failure
to recuperate valuable mined materials, and direct release of GHGs
including refrigerants (see Figure <a href="#fig:ewaste"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:ewaste">22</a> for
statistics on global E-waste generation and disposal in 2019). Moreover,
E-waste can often be shipped illegally to developing countries without
infrastructure for safe recycling <span class="citation"
data-cites="Forti2020 OECDLib">[264], [265]</span>. Exploding demand for
digital devices, fuelled by their fast obsolescence and difficulty to
repair, has also given rise to a boom in the mining industry. This

are usually unsafe and unpleasant, and causes deforestation and
pollution <span class="citation" data-cites="OECDLib">[265]</span>.</p>
<p>Increasing the life-span of consumer electronics through more
comprehensive right-to-repair legislation is an integral part of the
EU’s strategy for a circular economy <span class="citation"
data-cites="EUNews EUR2RSummary">[263], [266]</span>. According to a
2018 European Commission study, however, the cost of repair was the most
frequent reason consumers chose to replace four common household
electrical and electronic goods <span class="citation"
data-cites="ECConsumerStudy">[267]</span>. Right-to-repair advocates are
pushing for more comprehensive and far-reaching legislation, including
policies that will empower consumers to make simple repairs themselves,
as well as government incentives to repair through, e.g., financial
aid <span class="citation" data-cites="R2RPolicy">[268]</span>. A trial
scheme for the latter has already been implemented in France <span
class="citation" data-cites="FrenchRepairAid">[269]</span>.
Unfortunately, today’s legislation is formulated piecemeal and is slow
to take effect. In addition to instituting sustainable purchasing, use
and de-inventorising/disposal policies for electrical and electronic
goods (see Recommendations), HECAP+ institutions could encourage the
sustainable use of personal electronic devices by making repair
equipment freely available, with guidance from experts on a volunteer
basis.</p>

<p>Plastic is a versatile product; efficient, cheap, stable, and
infinitely mouldable. Its unique properties have resulted in our
increasing reliance on it over decades, making it very hard to live
without.</p>
<p>GHG emissions from production, use and disposal of conventional
(fossil-fuel-based) plastics is significant, and growing. It is expected
to increase to <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span>2.1 <span
data-acronym-label="tco2e"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">tco2e</span> per capita by 2040,
accounting for almost 20% of the global carbon budget <span
class="citation" data-cites="UNPollutionSolution">[270]</span>. Less
than one tenth of plastic waste produced to date has been recycled, with
the remainder being landfilled or incinerated <span class="citation"
data-cites="UNPollutionSolution">[270]</span>. This plastic waste
contaminates the natural environment. It is slow to degrade
(biodegradable plastics included), releasing potentially harmful
chemicals into the environment in the process, eventually breaking down
to micro- and nano-plastic particles that infiltrate the food chain.
Microplastics are also found in waste water, due to washing of synthetic
textiles, and in cosmetic and personal care products <span
class="citation" data-cites="Microplastics">[271]</span>. The health
impacts of ingested plastic waste are not yet completely understood, but
they are thought to alter metabolic pathways and hormone signalling in
animals.</p>
<p>A simple ban on single-use plastics, and plastics that are not at
least 99% recyclable would greatly limit microplastic pollution.</p>

<p>The amount of waste generated at conferences can be significantly
reduced by replacing printed timetables and welcome packs with a
well-designed conference app, see, e.g., Whova <span class="citation"

(e.g., e-vouchers/discounts for local restaurants or activities).
Sustainable stationery should be distributed on a need-only basis, and

In response to the growing problem of plastic pollution, the Australian

delegates included:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>plastic-free cardboard name badges with bamboo lanyards and metal
clips</p></li>
<li><p>complimentary fabric tote bags with conference logo</p></li>
<li><p>no printed envelopes for registration packs, no printed
conference abstracts</p></li>
<li><p>any printing necessary was done on sustainably-sourced paper,
using a solar-powered printer</p></li>
<li><p>sustainably-sourced pencils instead of pens, with sharpening
stations provided</p></li>
<li><p>no packaged sweets</p></li>
<li><p>delegates were asked to bring reusable water bottles, or

<li><p>reusable, washable plates, cups silverware and glassware for all

<h3 data-number="7.2.3" id="sec:CateringTableware"><span
class="header-section-number">7.2.3</span> Catering Tableware</h3>
<p>A life cycle analysis by the UN Environment Programme concludes that
“reusable tableware consistently outperforms single-use tableware in all
the studies and across all environmental impact categories (with water
use being the exception, because of washing). This type of analysis
takes into account all the variables that affect the environmental
impact of a product, from manufacturing to end-of-life treatment. The
case for reusable tableware is strengthened in countries where renewable
energy makes up a high proportion of the grid mix and where end-of-life
treatment options are not well developed” <span class="citation"
data-cites="UNEP2021">[274]</span>.</p>
<p>In outdoor or remote environments or ‘pop-up’ events with no fixed
catering facilities, where reusable tableware is impractical, single-use
biodegradable tableware is preferable to other single-use tableware if
it is industrially composted mixed in with food waste <span
class="citation" data-cites="UNEP2021">[274]</span>.<a href="#fn33"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>Unlike emissions due to reusables, which are dominated by their use
phase due to repeated washing, the main impact of biodegradable
tableware is due to its production. For conventional plastic, a
significant role is also played by end-of-life management. Quantitative
analysis of their relative emissions is thus strongly dependent on
assumptions about manufacture and disposal, including the material
demand. On the practical side, to minimise this impact when planning
conference catering one should always choose the lightest-weight
disposable tableware fit for purpose, preferably manufactured in a
country with a significant proportion of renewables in its energy and
electricity mix. For a comparison of emissions due to different choices
of disposable catering tableware for pop-up catering, see Case Study <a
href="#cs:conferencetableware" data-reference-type="ref"

<div class="marginline">
<p><span><strong>Case Study : Comparing tableware for pop-up
catering<span id="cs:conferencetableware"
label="cs:conferencetableware"></span></strong></span><br />
The production and disposal of single-use tableware has a significant
impact across all environmental factors, including acidification,
eutrophication, human health, land use and water depletion. However we
will focus here only on its GHG emissions.</p>
<p>We will consider for benchmarking purposes a large-scale conference
with 1,000 attendees and informal lunchtime catering (i.e., with no
dishwashing capability), and compare the life-cycle emissions due to
tableware made from conventional plastics, which are disposed of by a
combination of incineration and landfill according to the European
average (presumed food remnants making them unsuitable for recycling),
and from biodegradable bioplastics, which are industrially composted
along with the food remnants.</p>
<p>We assume each set of tableware consists of a dinner plate and cup, a
knife and fork, and a paper napkin and tray mat, all manufactured to the
same size and thickness, but with possible differences in weight due to
their respective material densities. A full list of assumptions and
details of the analysis can be found in the original article <span
class="citation" data-cites="Fieschi2018">[277]</span>.</p>
<p>The total emissions for 1,000 sets of conventional polystyrene
tableware is 221 kg <span data-acronym-label="co2e"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">co2e</span>, as compared with 109 kg
<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\mathrm{e}\)</span> for the
biodegradable bioplastic tableware, a saving of 112 kg <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\mathrm{e}\)</span>, around the
emissions of a flight from Paris to Geneva. For the purposes of
comparison, we include here the emissions cost of 1,000 dishes and cups
from a 2015 study by Italian plastics company Pro.mo <span
class="citation" data-cites="PROMO2015">[278]</span>. They put the total
emissions due to reusables at 26 kg <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\mathrm{e}\)</span>, with the
emissions due to conventional plastic dishes and cups (polypropylene in
this case) at 79 kg <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\mathrm{e}\)</span>. Note that these
figures are specific to the electricity and energy mix of the European
market, which has a large impact on the dominant emissions in all
cases.</p>

<p>The central message of this document is clear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span><strong>Assessing, reporting on, defining targets for, and
undertaking coordinated efforts to limit our negative impacts on the
world’s climate and ecosystems must become an integral part of how we
plan and undertake all aspects of our research.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Achieving this relies on individual-, group- and institution-level
actions, and concrete suggestions are made in this document.</p>
<p>This is a call to reflect with humility on these suggestions, and
this is a call to action. This is a call to consider the opportunities
that reassessing the environmental sustainability of our work practices
also offers for addressing systemic barriers to inclusivity and
accessibility.</p>
<p>But it must be understood that this and similar documents are only
the beginning: The <span data-acronym-label="hecap"

together to secure a sustainable future for our fields.</p>

<p>Our approach differs from existing estimates of the <span
data-acronym-label="ghg" data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">ghg</span>
footprint per researcher in the divisor used to compute this quantity.
We shared the emissions per resource equally by the total number using
that resource, whether it be total number of employees, or research
staff, or in the case of large laboratories like <span
data-acronym-label="cern"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">cern</span>, the number of Users,
rather than using the same divisor throughout. For instance, while we
divide the commuting emissions for each institute by the total number of
employees, we assign the business travel emissions solely to the
research staff, assuming the support staff have negligible long-distance
travel. For concreteness, we have colour-coded the per-researcher
estimates in Table <a href="#tab:ComparativeEmissionsData"

using Google currency converter. Carbon footprints for one-way travel
were calculated using Ref. <span class="citation"
data-cites="ecopassenger">[167]</span> and then doubled, using all
default assumptions, except for toggling on the climate factor for
flights. Precise departure and arrival information was not used for
calculation of the flight footprint. Since some airports are not
included as possible destinations, the footprint was calculated from the
central train station in the origin city to the central train station in
the destination city, and the footprint of travel to the airport is
assumed negligible (in comparison to the flight). Train fares quoted are
for the most convenient train journeys from the central station in the
origin city to the central station at the destination. For longer
journeys, preference was given to itineraries with overnight trains to
maximise efficiency per euro spent, assuming savings on an additional
night in a hotel. For all overnight trains, quoted prices include
reservation in shared sleeper cabin. Female-only occupancy can be
specified. Note that in many cases there may be a limited number of
‘super saver’ tickets that are available for purchase ahead of time. Air
fares were for the ‘best’ option available on Skyscanner <span
