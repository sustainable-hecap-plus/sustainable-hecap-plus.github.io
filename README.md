# sustainable-hecap-plus

The website `sustainable-hecap-plus` is an initiative by a volunteer network of scientists in the fields of High Energy Physics, Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics (HECAP) who are concerned about the climate crisis and advocating for a transition towards a sustainable academia.

The online platform `sustainable-hecap-plus` is the point of contact for HECAP scientists willing to learn, join the conversation or take actions towards more sustainability in HECAP.

## History
Following the workshop "Sustainable HEP" ([indico event](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1004432/)) in June 2021, several HECAP members started a reflexion culminating in a White Paper. This document represents a community-wide step towards identifying these impacts, proposing positive changes that individuals, groups and institutions can make, and highlighting the associated opportunities for improving social justice.
